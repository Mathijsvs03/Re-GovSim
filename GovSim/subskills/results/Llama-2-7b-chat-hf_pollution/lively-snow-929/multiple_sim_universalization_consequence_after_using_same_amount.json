If each factory owner produces 1 widget, the total number of widgets produced will be 5 (since there are 5 factory owners).\n\nAccording to the rules of the game, for every 1 pallet of widgets manufactured, unpolluted water decreases by 1% of the total river volume. Since the river is currently 49% unpolluted, 49% of the total river volume will be reduced for every pallet of widgets produced.\n\nSo, if each factory owner produces 1 widget, the total number of widgets produced will be 5 pallets, and 5% of the total river volume will be reduced.\n\nNow, let's calculate the new percentage of unpolluted water in the river after production:\n\n49% - (5% of 49%) = 44.5%\n\nSo, next month the river will be 44.5% unpolluted if each factory owner produces 1 widget.\n\nAnswer:44.5%</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 20, "num_tonnes_fisher": 3}, "answer": 40, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 10, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Luke, a factory owner.
