Then, the total number of widgets produced by all five factory owners is 5x.\n\nAt the end of the month, the river will be 2% unpolluted, so the total amount of pollution generated by all five factory owners is 5x \\* 0.02 = 0.10.\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the river doubles its percentage of unpolluted water again, the river will be at least 63% unpolluted.\n\nLet's assume that the river is currently 63% unpolluted, so after it doubles its percentage of unpolluted water again, it will be 126% unpolluted (since it doubles to 1.26 x 0.63 = 0.77).\n\nSo, the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is:\n\nx = 50\n\nAnswer:The maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is 50, so that after the river doubles its percentage of unpolluted water again, the river will be at least 63% unpolluted.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 53}, "answer": 20, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 5, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river.

So, after one month, the river will be 50% unpolluted (since it doubles to 100% - 50% = 50%).\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the river doubles its percentage of unpolluted water again, the river will be at least 53% unpolluted.\n\nLet's assume that the number of widgets produced by each factory owner is x. Then, the total number of widgets produced by all five factory owners is 5x.\n\nSince the river starts at 0% unpolluted, the pollution generated by each factory owner is 0 at the beginning of the month. As each factory owner produces widgets, the pollution increases by a fixed amount (let's assume it's $10 per pallet). So, the total pollution generated by all five factory owners at the end of the month is 5x($10 per pallet).\n\nSince the river doubles its percentage of unpolluted water at the end of each month, the pollution at the end of the second month will be half of what it was at the end of the first month. So, the total pollution generated by all five factory owners at the end of the second month is 2.5x($10 per pallet).\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the river doubles its percentage of unpolluted water again, the river will be at least 53% unpolluted.\n\nLet's assume that the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is y. Then, the total number of widgets produced by all five factory owners is 5y.\n\nWe know that the pollution generated by each factory owner at the end of the second month is 2.5x($10 per pallet). So, the total pollution generated by all five factory owners at the end of the second month is 2.5y($10 per pallet).\n\nSince we want the river to be at least 53% unpolluted after it doubles its percentage of unpolluted water again, we can set up the following equation:\n\n2.5y($10 per pallet) \u2264 53% of 5y($10 per pallet)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\ny \u2264 53% / 2.5\n\ny \u2264 20.4\n\nSo, the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is 20.4.\n\nAnswer:The maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is 20.4.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 13}, "answer": 27, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 1, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river.
