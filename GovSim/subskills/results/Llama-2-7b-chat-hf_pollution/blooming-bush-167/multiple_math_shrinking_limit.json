As each factory owner produces widgets, the pollution increases by a fixed amount (let's assume it's $10 per pallet). So, the total pollution generated by all five factory owners at the end of the month is 5x($10 per pallet).\n\nSince the river doubles its percentage of unpolluted water at the end of each month, the pollution at the end of the second month will be half of what it was at the end of the first month. So, the total pollution generated by all five factory owners at the end of the second month is 2.5x($10 per pallet).\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the river doubles its percentage of unpolluted water again, the river will be at least 53% unpolluted.\n\nLet's assume that the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is y. Then, the total number of widgets produced by all five factory owners is 5y.\n\nWe know that the pollution generated by each factory owner at the end of the second month is 2.5x($10 per pallet). So, the total pollution generated by all five factory owners at the end of the second month is 2.5y($10 per pallet).\n\nSince we want the river to be at least 53% unpolluted after it doubles its percentage of unpolluted water again, we can set up the following equation:\n\n2.5y($10 per pallet) \u2264 53% of 5y($10 per pallet)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\ny \u2264 53% / 2.5\n\ny \u2264 20.4\n\nSo, the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is 20.4.\n\nAnswer:The maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is 20.4.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Jack", "num_tonnes_lake": 83}, "answer": 8, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 8, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river. At the beginning of each month, each factory owner chooses to manufacture between 0 and 100 pallets of widgets, and corresponding pollution is generated. At the end of the month, the river recovers, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. This month, the river is 83% unpolluted.\n What is the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 83% unpolluted?\nLet's think step-by-step. Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  Great, let's solve this problem step-by-step!\n\nWe know that the river starts at 0% unpolluted water and doubles its percentage at the end of each month. So, after one month, the river will be 2% unpolluted (since 100% is doubled to 200%, and 200% of 0 is 0.02).\n\nNext, we know that each factory owner can produce between 0 and 100 pallets of widgets per month, and the corresponding pollution is generated. Let's assume that the maximum number of pallets each factory owner can produce is x.\n\nWe also know that the total pollution generated by all five factory owners is equal to the percentage of unpolluted water at the end of the month. So, if the river is 83% unpolluted at the end of the month, the total pollution generated is 83%.\n\nNow, we can set up a system of linear equations to find the maximum number of widgets each factory owner can produce, so that after the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 83% unpolluted.\n\nLet's call the number of pallets produced by each factory owner \"x\". Then, we can write the following equations:\n\n1. The total number of pallets produced by all five factory owners is equal to the maximum number of pallets produced by each factory owner (since each factory owner can produce up to 100 pallets):\n\n5x = 500 (since 5 factory owners produce a total of 500 pallets)\n\n2. The total pollution generated by all five factory owners is equal to the percentage of unpolluted water at the end of the month:\n\n5x \\* 0.83 = 41.5 (since 83% of 500 is 41.5)\n\nNow, we can solve the system of equations to find the maximum number of widgets each factory owner can produce:\n\nx = 41.5 / 5 = 8.3\n\nSo, the maximum number of widgets each factory owner can produce is 8.3 pallets.\n\nAnswer:8.3 pallets.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.13333333333333333, "score_std": 0.33993463423951903, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.30536083271818926, "config": {"code_version": "v7.1", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_pollution", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 1181241943, "split": "single"}}
