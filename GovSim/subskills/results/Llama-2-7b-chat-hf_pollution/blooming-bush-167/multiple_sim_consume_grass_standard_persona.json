At the end of the month, the river recovers, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf we produce 0 pallets of widgets, the river will remain at 13% unpolluted, and we will earn $0.\nIf we produce 1-10 pallets of widgets, we will reduce the river's unpolluted water by 1% to 10% respectively, and we will earn $1,000 to $10,000.\nIf we produce 11-13 pallets of widgets, we will reduce the river's unpolluted water by 11% to 13% respectively, and we will earn $11,000 to $13,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the optimal production level:\n\nLet's assume the river's unpolluted water is X% at the beginning of the month.\n\nIf we produce y pallets of widgets, the river's unpolluted water will decrease by 1% to X-1%.\n\nOur income will be $1,000 + (X-1)% of $10,000.\n\nTo maximize our income, we should produce the number of pallets that gives us the highest income.\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\nAnswer:We should produce 11 pallets of widgets.\n\nExplanation: By producing 11 pallets of widgets, we will reduce the river's unpolluted water by 11%, which is the highest reduction possible given the production range. This will give us an income of $11,000, which is the highest possible income for this scenario.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 98}, "answer": 50, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 9, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a factory owner.
