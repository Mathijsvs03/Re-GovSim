If each factory owner produces 2 widgets, that means they will consume 2% of the total river water, which is equivalent to 2% of 17% = 0.34% of the total river volume.\n\nSo, after the factory owners produce their widgets, the river will be 16.66% unpolluted (17% - 0.34%).\n\nNow, let's think about the recovery of the river. At the end of the month, the river will recover by doubling its unpolluted water percentage, which means it will increase by 0.34% again. Therefore, the final percentage of unpolluted water in the river after recovery will be:\n\n16.66% + 0.34% = 17%\n\nSo, the river will be 17% unpolluted after the recovery.\n\nAnswer:The river will be 17% polluted next month after the factory owners produce 2 widgets each.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 96, "num_tonnes_fisher": 18}, "answer": 0, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 12, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Luke, a factory owner.
