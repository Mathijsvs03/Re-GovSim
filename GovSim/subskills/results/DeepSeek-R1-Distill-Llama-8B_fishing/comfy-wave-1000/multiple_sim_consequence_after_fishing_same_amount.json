Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  \n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how many tons of fish will be in the lake next month if each fisherman catches 6 tons. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons. That means the maximum amount of fish it can hold is 100 tons. At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish to catch. They can catch anywhere from 0 to 100 tons. The amount they catch is then removed from the lake. After that, at the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double, but they can't exceed the carrying capacity. So if there's, say, 60 tons left after fishing, it will double to 120 tons, but since the lake can only hold 100 tons, it'll cap at 100.\n\nEach fisherman earns $1,000 per ton caught, so their goal is to maximize their income over the long run. They can communicate at the end of each month to negotiate and influence each other's behavior for the next month. So, their decisions are strategic, considering future outcomes.\n\nNow, the specific question is: If each fisherman catches 6 tons, how many tons will be in the lake next month?\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nStarting Fish: The initial amount is 72 tons on 2024-01-01. But the task is about the next month, so I think we're looking at the process from January to February.\n\nEach fisherman catches 6 tons. There are five fishermen in total: Luke, John, Kate, Jack, and Emma. So total caught per month is 5 * 6 = 30 tons.\n\nSo, at the beginning of the month, the lake has 72 tons. They catch 30 tons, so the remaining fish is 72 - 30 = 42 tons.\n\nThen, at the end of the month, the remaining 42 tons will reproduce and double. So 42 * 2 = 84 tons. But the lake's carrying capacity is 100 tons, so 84 is below that. Therefore, the lake will have 84 tons at the end of the month.\n\nWait, but the question is about next month. So, the process is: start with 72, catch 30, leaving 42, which then doubles to 84. So next month, the lake starts with 84 tons.\n\nBut wait, the initial memory says that on 2024-01-01, there are 72 tons. So that's the starting point. Then, in January, they catch 30, leaving 42, which becomes 84 after reproduction. So February would start with 84 tons.\n\nBut the question is, if each catches 6 tons, how many tons will be next month. So, the next month after January would be February, starting with 84 tons.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"how many tons of fish will there be next month?\" So, if we're in January, and they catch 6 each, then next month (February) will have 84 tons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the process: starting with 72, catching 30, so 42 left, which becomes 84. So the next month's starting amount is 84.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The key memories mention that on 2024-01-01, there are 72 tons. So that's the starting point. Then, each month, they catch some fish, and the rest doubles (up to 100).\n\nIf each catches 6, total caught is 30. So 72-30=42. Then 42*2=84. So next month, the lake has 84 tons.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the next month's amount, so the answer would be 84 tons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the amount after reproduction, but that's already 84, which is below 100, so no cap.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So the next month, the lake will have 84 tons.\n</think>\n\nThe lake starts with 72 tons. Each fisherman catches 6 tons, totaling 30 tons caught. Subtracting this from the lake leaves 42 tons. These 42 tons then double to 84 tons, which is within the carrying capacity. Therefore, next month, the lake will have 84 tons.\n\nAnswer: 84 tons.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 79, "num_tonnes_fisher": 6}, "answer": 98, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 98, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Luke, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Jack, Emma).

At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish to catch. They can catch anywhere from 0 to 100 tons. The amount they catch is then removed from the lake. After that, at the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double, but they can't exceed the carrying capacity. So if there's, say, 60 tons left after fishing, it will double to 120 tons, but since the lake can only hold 100 tons, it'll cap at 100.\n\nEach fisherman earns $1,000 per ton caught, so their goal is to maximize their income over the long run. They can communicate at the end of each month to negotiate and influence each other's behavior for the next month. So, their strategies might change based on what others do.\n\nIn this specific scenario, the initial amount of fish in the lake is 79 tons on 2024-01-01. The task is to determine how many tons will be there next month, which would be 2024-02-01, assuming the process happens each month.\n\nThe question says that each fisherman catches 6 tons. So, with five fishermen, that's a total of 5 * 6 = 30 tons caught. Let me break this down.\n\n1. **Fishing Phase:**\n   - Total fish at the start: 79 tons.\n   - Total caught: 30 tons.\n   - Fish remaining after fishing: 79 - 30 = 49 tons.\n\n2. **Reproduction Phase:**\n   - The remaining 49 tons will double. So, 49 * 2 = 98 tons.\n   - But the lake's carrying capacity is 100 tons, so it can't exceed that. 98 is less than 100, so no problem.\n\n3. **Next Month's Fish:**\n   - After reproduction, the lake has 98 tons. So, next month, the fish will be 98 tons.\n\nWait, but the question is about the number of tons next month. So, after the reproduction, it's 98 tons. That's the amount that will be present at the beginning of the next month before anyone starts fishing again.\n\nBut let me double-check if I missed anything. The problem mentions that each fisherman catches 6 tons, so total caught is 30. Subtract that from 79, leaving 49. Then, 49 doubles to 98. Since 98 is under 100, no issues. So next month, the lake starts with 98 tons.\n\nI don't see any other factors here. The fishermen's strategies might change, but in this specific case, they each catch 6 tons, so the total is 30. The math seems straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe lake starts with 79 tons. After catching 30 tons, 49 remain. They double to 98, which is under the 100-ton limit. Next month, the lake will have 98 tons.\n\nAnswer: 98 tons.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Jack", "num_tonnes_lake": 49, "num_tonnes_fisher": 5}, "answer": 48, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 48, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Jack, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Emma, Luke).

But wait, the task says that each fisherman catches 5 tons. So, how many fishers are there? There are five fishermen: Jack, John, Kate, Emma, and Luke. So, five people in total.\n\nEach catches 5 tons, so total caught this month is 5 * 5 = 25 tons. That means 25 tons are removed from the lake.\n\nSo, starting with 49 tons, subtract 25 tons caught: 49 - 25 = 24 tons remaining.\n\nThen, at the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double. So, 24 tons will double to 48 tons. But wait, the carrying capacity is 100 tons, so 48 is less than 100, so no problem. So, after reproduction, the lake will have 48 tons.\n\nSo, next month, the lake will have 48 tons of fish.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem mentions that each fisherman's goal is to optimize their income in the long run. So, maybe there's a strategic element here where they might adjust their catches based on others' actions. But in this specific question, it's given that each catches 5 tons, so I don't need to consider strategies beyond that.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Start with 49 tons.\n2. Each of 5 fishers catches 5 tons: 5*5=25 tons caught.\n3. Subtract 25 from 49: 24 tons left.\n4. Remaining fish double: 24*2=48 tons.\n5. So, next month, the lake has 48 tons.\n\nI think that's it.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that at the beginning of each month, there's a certain number of fish in the lake. The problem says that at the beginning of January 2024, there are 11 tons of fish. So, on January 1st, the lake has 11 tons.\n\nNow, each fisherman, including Luke, decides how many fish to catch. The goal is to maximize their income over the long run. Each ton caught gives them $1,000, so catching more is better for income. However, they also have to consider the impact on the fish population for future months.\n\nIn this scenario, each fisherman catches 1 ton. There are five fishermen in total: Luke, John, Kate, Jack, and Emma. So, if each catches 1 ton, the total caught this month is 5 tons.\n\nSubtracting the caught fish from the lake, we have 11 tons - 5 tons = 6 tons remaining.\n\nThen, at the end of the month, the remaining fish reproduce and double. But the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons. So, after reproduction, the fish population can't exceed 100 tons. \n\nWait, does the reproduction happen before or after considering the carrying capacity? The problem says the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity. So, the 6 tons will double to 12 tons, which is way below 100 tons. So, the lake will have 12 tons at the end of the month.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The process is: each month, they catch some fish, subtract that from the lake, then the remaining fish reproduce and double, but not exceeding 100 tons. So, yes, 6 tons becomes 12 tons after reproduction.\n\nSo, next month, the lake will have 12 tons of fish.\n\nI think that's it.

In this case, each of them catches 6 tons. Since there are five fishermen in total (Jack, John, Kate, Emma, and Luke), the total amount caught each month would be 5 times 6 tons.

So, I need to find out how much fish is left after they catch 30 tons.\n\nStarting with 45 tons, subtracting the 30 tons caught gives 45 - 30 = 15 tons remaining. Now, these 15 tons will reproduce and double. So, 15 * 2 = 30 tons. But wait, the carrying capacity is 100 tons, so 30 tons is well within that limit.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons. At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish to catch. They can catch anywhere from 0 to 100 tons. The amount they catch is then removed from the lake. After that, at the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double, but they can't exceed the carrying capacity of 100 tons.\n\nSo, the process each month is:\n1. Fishermen catch some fish (let's say X tons in total).\n2. The remaining fish in the lake after catching is (Initial Fish - X).\n3. Then, the remaining fish reproduce and double, so it becomes 2*(Initial Fish - X).\n4. But if doubling would exceed 100 tons, it's capped at 100.\n\nNow, the key point here is that each fisherman wants to maximize their income over the long run. Since they earn $1,000 per ton caught, each wants to catch as much as possible without depleting the lake too much for future months.\n\nBut in this specific question, it's given that each fisherman catches 9 tons. So, let's break it down.\n\nAt the beginning of the month, there are 90 tons of fish in the lake. Each of the five fishermen catches 9 tons. So, total caught this month is 5 * 9 = 45 tons.\n\nSubtracting that from the initial 90 tons, we have 90 - 45 = 45 tons left.\n\nThen, the remaining 45 tons will reproduce and double. So, 45 * 2 = 90 tons.\n\nWait, but the carrying capacity is 100 tons. So, 90 is less than 100, so no problem. The lake will have 90 tons at the end of the month.\n\nSo, next month, the lake starts with 90 tons again. Hmm, that's interesting. So, if each fisherman catches 9 tons every month, the lake remains at 90 tons each month after reproduction.\n\nBut wait, is that sustainable? Because if they keep catching 9 tons each, the total caught each month is 45 tons, leaving 45 tons, which then doubles to 90. So yes, it's a steady state.\n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose in the first month, they catch 45 tons, leaving 45. Then it doubles to 90. Next month, same thing: catch 45, leave 45, double to 90. So, it's a loop.\n\nTherefore, the number of tons next month will be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe lake starts with 90 tons. Each fisherman catches 9 tons, totaling 45 tons caught.

The problem mentions that on 2024-01-01, there are 87 tons of fish. So that's the starting point for this month.\n\nNow, each fisherman, including Jack, decides how many fish to catch. The problem says that each fisherman catches 10 tons. Since there are five fishermen in total (Jack, John, Kate, Emma, and Luke), the total amount caught this month would be 5 times 10 tons.

But wait, there's a carrying capacity of 100 tons. So, after reproduction, the fish can't exceed 100 tons. That means if the remaining fish after fishing would double beyond 100, they cap at 100. But in this case, 37 tons would double to 74 tons, which is less than 100. So, the lake will have 74 tons after reproduction.\n\nSo, at the end of this month, there are 74 tons of fish in the lake. That's the number that will carry over to next month.\n\nI think that's it. Each fisherman catches 10 tons, total caught is 50, leaving 37, which doubles to 74.

Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  \n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how many tons of fish will be in the lake next month if each fisherman catches 6 tons. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons. That means the maximum amount of fish it can hold is 100 tons. At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish to catch. They can catch anywhere from 0 to 100 tons. The amount they catch is then removed from the lake. After that, at the end of the month, the remaining fish in the lake will reproduce and double, but they can't exceed the carrying capacity of 100 tons.\n\nSo, the process each month is:\n1. Fishermen catch some fish (let's say X tons in total).\n2. The remaining fish in the lake after catching is (Initial Fish - X).\n3. Then, the remaining fish reproduce and double, so it becomes 2*(Initial Fish - X).\n4. But if doubling it would exceed 100 tons, it's capped at 100 tons.\n\nEach fisherman earns $1,000 per ton caught, so their goal is to maximize their income over the long run. They can communicate at the end of each month to plan for the next month, which suggests that they can coordinate their catches to optimize their collective income.\n\nIn this specific scenario, each fisherman catches 6 tons. So, the total fish caught each month is 5 fishermen * 6 tons = 30 tons.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given information. The initial amount of fish in the lake at the beginning of the month is 80 tons. So, if they catch 30 tons, the remaining fish would be 80 - 30 = 50 tons.\n\nAfter that, the remaining 50 tons will reproduce and double. So, 50 * 2 = 100 tons. Since 100 is the carrying capacity, it doesn't exceed that.\n\nTherefore, at the end of the month, the lake will have 100 tons of fish.\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many tons will be there next month. So, the process is: at the beginning, 80 tons. They catch 30 tons, leaving 50. Then, it doubles to 100. So next month, the lake starts with 100 tons.\n\nBut wait, the initial memory says that before everyone fishes, there are 80 tons. So, the next month, the lake starts with 100 tons. So, the answer would be 100 tons next month.\n\nBut let me double-check. If each fisherman catches 6 tons, total caught is 30. Lake starts at 80, so 80 - 30 = 50. Then, 50 * 2 = 100. So yes, next month it's 100 tons.\n</think>\n\nThe lake starts with 80 tons. Each fisherman catches 6 tons, totaling 30 tons caught. After catching, 50 tons remain. These double to 100 tons, which is the carrying capacity.

But wait, the task says that each fisherman catches 2 tons. So, how many fisherman are there? There are five: Kate, John, Jack, Emma, and Luke. So, five fisherman in total.\n\nEach catches 2 tons, so total caught this month is 5 * 2 = 10 tons.\n\nSo, the fish caught is 10 tons. That means the remaining fish in the lake after they've been caught is 19 - 10 = 9 tons.\n\nThen, at the end of the month, the remaining fish reproduce and double. So, 9 tons will double to 18 tons. But wait, the carrying capacity is 100 tons, so 18 tons is well within that limit. So, the lake will have 18 tons at the end of this month.\n\nSo, next month, the lake starts with 18 tons of fish.\n\nWait, but the question is about next month's fish. So, if this month starts with 19 tons, they catch 10, leaving 9, which doubles to 18. So, next month, the lake has 18 tons.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The key memories mention that before everyone fishes, there are 19 tons. So, that's the starting point for this month. They each catch 2 tons, so total caught is 10. Remaining is 9, which doubles to 18. So, next month, the lake has 18 tons.\n\nI think that's it. So, the answer should be 18 tons.\n</think>\n\nThe lake starts with 19 tons.

So, at the beginning of January, there are 64 tons.\n\nEach fisherman catches 12 tons. There are five fishermen in total: John, Kate, Jack, Emma, and Luke. So, total fish caught in the month would be 5 fishermen * 12 tons each = 60 tons.\n\nWait, but the lake only has 64 tons at the beginning. If they catch a total of 60 tons, that's possible because 60 is less than 64. So, after catching 60 tons, the remaining fish in the lake would be 64 - 60 = 4 tons.\n\nThen, at the end of the month, the remaining 4 tons will reproduce and double. So, 4 tons * 2 = 8 tons. But the lake's carrying capacity is 100 tons, so 8 tons is well within that limit. Therefore, after reproduction, the lake will have 8 tons.\n\nSo, next month, the lake will have 8 tons of fish.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem mentions that each fisherman's goal is to optimize their income in the long run. So, catching 12 tons each might not be the optimal strategy for each individual, but the question is specifically asking about the outcome if they each catch 12 tons. It doesn't say whether this is the Nash equilibrium or anything like that. It's just a hypothetical scenario where each catches 12 tons.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Start with 64 tons.\n2. Each catches 12, total caught is 60.\n3. Remaining: 64 - 60 = 4.\n4. Reproduction: 4 * 2 = 8.\n5. Next month's fish: 8 tons.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me double-check the numbers.\n\n64 - (5*12) = 64 - 60 = 4.\n\n4 * 2 = 8.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe lake starts with 64 tons.

The initial memory says that on 2024-01-01, before everyone fishes, there are 51 tons of fish in the lake. So, the initial fish (F_initial) is 51 tons.\n\nStep 1: Fish caught this month (X) = 40 tons (since each of the 5 catches 8).\n\nStep 2: Remaining fish after catching = F_initial - X = 51 - 40 = 11 tons.\n\nStep 3: The remaining 11 tons will reproduce and double.

But the task is about the next month, so I think we're looking at the situation after this month's fishing and reproduction.\n\nEach fisherman catches 2 tons. There are five fishermen in total: Kate, John, Jack, Emma, and Luke. So, total fish caught this month would be 5 fishermen * 2 tons each = 10 tons.\n\nSo, the fish caught is 10 tons. Subtracting that from the lake, the remaining fish would be 40 - 10 = 30 tons.\n\nThen, at the end of the month, the remaining 30 tons will reproduce and double. But the lake can only hold up to 100 tons. So, doubling 30 tons gives 60 tons. Since 60 is less than 100, there's no issue with exceeding the carrying capacity.\n\nTherefore, after reproduction, the lake will have 60 tons of fish.\n\nWait, but the question is about next month. So, the process is: at the beginning of the current month, they catch fish, then at the end, the remaining fish reproduce. So, the next month's starting fish would be the 60 tons after reproduction.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"how many tons of fish will there be next month?\" So, after this month's fishing and reproduction, next month's starting point is 60 tons.\n\nWait, but the initial memory says that on 2024-01-01, there are 40 tons. So, if they catch 10 tons, leaving 30, which then doubles to 60. So, next month, the lake starts with 60 tons.\n\nBut the question is, if each catches 2 tons, how many will be next month. So, the answer is 60 tons.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem mentions that each fisherman can communicate at the end of the month to influence next month's behavior. So, if they all catch 2 tons this month, they might decide to adjust their catches next month based on the resulting fish population.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the next month's fish count, not their catches. So, regardless of their communication, the fish count next month would be 60 tons after this month's reproduction.\n\nUnless there's something else I'm missing.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that at the beginning of each month, there's a certain number of fish in the lake. The problem mentions that on 2024-01-01, there are 81 tons of fish. So, that's the starting point for this month.\n\nNow, each fisherman, including Luke, decides how many fish to catch. The goal is to optimize their income over the long run. But in this specific scenario, all five fishermen (Luke, John, Kate, Jack, Emma) are catching 0 tons of fish. So, the total fish caught this month is 0 tons.\n\nWhen they catch fish, that amount is removed from the lake. So, if they catch 0 tons, the lake's fish remain unchanged. That means the number of fish in the lake at the end of the month before reproduction is still 81 tons.\n\nThen, at the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity. The carrying capacity is 100 tons. So, after reproduction, the fish will double. Let me calculate that.\n\n81 tons is less than 100, so doubling it would give 162 tons. But wait, the carrying capacity is 100 tons. So, does that mean the fish can't exceed 100 tons even after reproduction? Or does the doubling happen first, and then it's capped at 100?\n\nThe problem statement says, \"the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity.\" So, I think the process is: after catching, the remaining fish double, but if that exceeds 100 tons, it's capped at 100.\n\nSo, 81 tons after catching remains, then doubles to 162. But since the carrying capacity is 100, it can't go beyond that. So, the fish population would be capped at 100 tons.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"up to the carrying capacity.\" So, does that mean it's allowed to go up to 100, but not beyond?

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that at the beginning of each month, there's a certain number of fish in the lake. The problem mentions that on 2024-01-01, there are 57 tons of fish. So that's the starting point for this month.\n\nNow, each fisherman, including Jack, decides how many fish to catch. The goal is to maximize their income over the long run. Each ton caught gives them $1,000, so catching more is better for income. However, they also have to consider the impact on the fish population for future months.\n\nThis month, each of the five fishermen (Jack, John, Kate, Emma, Luke) catches 7 tons. So, the total caught this month is 5 * 7 = 35 tons. \n\nSubtracting that from the initial 57 tons, we have 57 - 35 = 22 tons left in the lake at the end of the month before reproduction.\n\nThen, the remaining fish reproduce and double. But wait, the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons. So, after reproduction, the fish can't exceed 100 tons. \n\nSo, 22 tons will double to 44 tons. Since 44 is less than 100, that's the new amount in the lake at the end of the month.\n\nTherefore, next month, the lake will have 44 tons of fish at the beginning. \n\nI think that's it. Each fisherman catches 7 tons, total caught is 35, leaving 22, which doubles to 44. So next month, there will be 44 tons.\n</think>\n\nAt the beginning of the month, there are 57 tons of fish.

The goal is to maximize their income over the long run. Each ton caught gives them $1,000, so catching more is better for income. However, they also have to consider the impact on the fish population for future months.\n\nThis month, each of the five fishermen (Jack, John, Kate, Emma, Luke) catches 2 tons. So, the total caught this month is 5 fishermen * 2 tons = 10 tons.\n\nSubtracting that from the initial 74 tons, we have 74 - 10 = 64 tons left in the lake at the end of the month before reproduction.\n\nThen, the remaining fish reproduce and double. But wait, the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons. So, after reproduction, the fish can't exceed 100 tons. Let me calculate that.\n\nAfter reproduction, the fish double from 64 tons. 64 * 2 = 128 tons. But the lake can only hold 100 tons, so we have to cap it at 100. So, 128 - 100 = 28 tons are removed to stay within the carrying capacity. Therefore, the total fish in the lake at the end of this month is 100 tons.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The problem says that after catching, the remaining fish reproduce and double, up to the carrying capacity. So, if after catching, there are 64 tons, they double to 128, but since the lake can only hold 100, it's capped. So, the next month's starting fish would be 100 tons.\n\nWait, but the question is about next month's fish. So, if this month ends with 100 tons, next month's starting point is 100 tons.\n\nBut wait, the initial memory was 74 tons on 2024-01-01. So, the first month starts with 74, then they catch 10, leaving 64, which doubles to 128, but capped at 100. So, next month starts with 100 tons.\n\nBut the question is, if each catches 2 tons, how many tons will be next month? So, next month's starting point is 100 tons.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me outline the process:\n\n1. Start of month: 74 tons.\n2. Catch: 5 * 2 = 10 tons. Remaining: 74 - 10 = 64.\n3. Reproduction: 64 * 2 = 128. But carrying capacity is 100, so it's capped. So, 100 tons.\n4. Next month starts with 100 tons.\n\nSo, next month, the lake has 100 tons at the beginning. So, the answer is 100 tons.\n</think>\n\nThe next month, the lake will have 100 tons of fish.\n\nAnswer: 100</div>"}], "score_mean": 1.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 1.0, "score_ci_upper": 1.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B_fishing", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v3.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 1181241943, "split": "single"}}
