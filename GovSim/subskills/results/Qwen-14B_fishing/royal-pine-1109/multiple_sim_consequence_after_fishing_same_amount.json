At the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity of 100 tons.

If each fisherman catches 4 tons again, there will be 80 - 4 \\* 5 = 80 - 20 = 60 tons of fish left after the second month. This pattern will continue, and the amount of fish in the lake will decrease by 4 tons each month. Therefore, if each fisherman catches 4 tons, there will be 60 tons of fish left after 25 months, and the lake will be depleted of fish after that.

The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish. At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish between 0 and 100 tons to catch from the lake, and that amount is then removed from the lake. At the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity. For every ton of fish caught, a fisherman earns one thousand dollars. Each fisherman's goal is to optimize his income in the long run over many months.
