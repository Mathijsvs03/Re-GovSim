If a shepherd takes 100 hectares of grass, there will be no grass left for the other shepherds.\n4. Therefore, the maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture is 63/100 = 0.63 (or 63%) of the total grass.\n5. Since there are 5 shepherds, the total number of flocks of sheep that can be taken to the pasture is 5 x 0.63 = 3.15 (or 315%) flocks.\n\nAnswer:Each shepherd can take up to 315 flocks of sheep to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Ava", "num_tonnes_lake": 53}, "answer": 10, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 5, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five shepherd share a pasture.

The pasture can support a maximum of 100 hectares of grass, so we know that the total number of flocks of sheep that can be taken to the pasture is:\n\n100 hectares / 1 hectare per flock = 100 flocks\n\n2. Each shepherd can take a maximum of 100 / 5 = 20 flocks of sheep to the pasture.\n\n3. Since there are 13 hectares of grass in the pasture, we know that the total number of flocks of sheep that can be taken to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass is:\n\n13 hectares / 1 hectare per flock = 13 flocks\n\n4. Since each shepherd can take a maximum of 20 flocks of sheep to the pasture, the maximum number of flocks that each shepherd can take is:\n\n20 flocks - 13 flocks = 7 flocks\n\nAnswer:Each shepherd can take 7 flocks of sheep to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_sheep", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 2746317213, "split": "single"}}
