Since we don't need to buy food for the sheep we take to the pasture, our income is directly proportional to the number of flocks we can take without depleting the grass.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to find the maximum number of flocks each shepherd can take to the pasture:\n\nStep 1: Determine the maximum number of flocks that can be taken without depleting the grass.\n\nLet X be the number of flocks taken by each shepherd. Since we don't want to deplete the grass, we need to ensure that the total number of flocks taken does not exceed the available grass. In this case, the available grass is 70 hectares.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total grass consumed by all shepherds.\n\nIf each shepherd takes X flocks to the pasture, the total grass consumed will be X hectares.\n\nStep 3: Check if the total grass consumed is less than or equal to the available grass.\n\nIf the total grass consumed is less than or equal to 70 hectares, then we can take that number of flocks without depleting the grass. Otherwise, we need to reduce the number of flocks we take.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum number of flocks each shepherd can take without depleting the grass. We can do this by solving the following equation:\n\n70 = X + X + ... + X (where X is the number of flocks taken by each shepherd)\n\nSince there are five shepherds, we need to add the number of flocks taken by each shepherd five times:\n\n70 = 5X\n\nNow, we can solve for X:\n\nX = 70 / 5\n\nX = 14\n\nSo, each shepherd can take 14 flocks of sheep to the pasture without depleting the grass.\n\nAnswer:Each shepherd can take 14 flocks of sheep to the pasture without depleting the grass.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Olivia", "num_tonnes_lake": 62}, "answer": 7, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 6, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Olivia, a shepherd.

We know that the pasture can support a maximum of 100 hectares of grass, and each flock of sheep eats 1 hectare of grass per month. This means that if we take more than 100 flocks of sheep to the pasture, we will deplete the grass supply and there will be none left for the next month.\n\nSince there are 5 shepherds and each shepherd can take between 0 and 100 flocks of sheep to the pasture, we need to find the maximum number of flocks that each shepherd can take without depleting the grass supply.\n\nLet's start by assuming that each shepherd takes the same number of flocks to the pasture. We can let x be the number of flocks that each shepherd takes.\n\nSince there are 5 shepherds, the total number of flocks that are taken to the pasture is 5x.\n\nWe know that the available grass in the pasture is 61 hectares, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n5x <= 61\n\nSince we want to maximize the number of flocks that each shepherd can take, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n5x = 61\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 61 / 5\n\nx = 12\n\nSo, each shepherd can take 12 flocks of sheep to the pasture without depleting the grass supply.\n\nAnswer:Each shepherd can take 12 flocks of sheep to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.13333333333333333, "score_std": 0.339934634239519, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.30536083271818926, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_sheep", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 958682846, "split": "single"}}
