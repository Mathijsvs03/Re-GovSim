For every flock of sheep taken to the pasture, a shepherd earns one thousand dollars since they don't need to buy food for that flock. Each shepherd's goal is to maximize their income over the long term. At the end of each month, the number of sheep taken to the pasture by each shepherd will be revealed, and the shepherds will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this as an opportunity to negotiate and persuade others to influence their behavior in the next month. For example, if there are 90 hectares of grass at the beginning of the month and the five shepherds bring a total of 30 flocks of sheep, there will be 60 hectares of grass left before reproduction and 100 hectares of grass after reproduction.\nLocation: pasture\nDate: 2024-01-01\n\nKey memories of Kate (format: YYYY-MM-DD: memory):\n- 2024-01-01: Before the shepherds take their flocks of sheep to the pasture, there are 39 hectares of grass available.\n\n\nTask:  If each shepherd takes 4 flocks of sheep to the pasture, how many hectares of grass will there be next month?\nLet's think step-by-step.
