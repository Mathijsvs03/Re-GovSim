Each flock of sheep eats 1 hectare of grass per month, so the total amount of grass eaten by all the flocks of sheep is 100 hectares x 12 months = 1200 hectares.\n3. Since the grass in the pasture doubles in quantity every month, the remaining grass after each flock of sheep has eaten its share is 1200 hectares / 81 hectares (the current amount of grass) = 15.09 flocks of sheep.\n4. Since each shepherd takes the same number of flocks of sheep to the pasture, the maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass is 15 flocks.\n\nAnswer:Each shepherd can take up to 15 flocks of sheep to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.06666666666666667, "score_std": 0.24944382578492946, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.1929003400397002, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_sheep", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 2746317213, "split": "single"}}
