Since each shepherd earns $1,000 for each flock of sheep they take to the pasture, the more flocks they take, the more income they will earn.\n\nHowever, the key constraint is that the total number of flocks of sheep taken by all five shepherds cannot exceed the maximum capacity of the pasture, which is 100 hectares.\n\nSo, the question is: How many flocks of sheep can each shepherd take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass?\n\nTo answer this, we need to find the maximum number of flocks that can be taken without exceeding the total capacity of the pasture.\n\nLet's assume that each shepherd takes the same number of flocks of sheep to the pasture. Let's call this number \"x\".\n\nThe total number of flocks of sheep that can be taken to the pasture is equal to the number of shepherds multiplied by the number of flocks each shepherd takes:\n\nTotal flocks = 5 shepherds x x flocks\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of \"x\" that will allow us to keep the quantity of grass constant at 61 hectares.\n\nTo do this, we can set up a simple equation:\n\n61 hectares = 5 x x flocks\n\nNow, we can solve for \"x\" by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:\n\nx = 61 hectares / 5\n\nx = 12.2 flocks per shepherd\n\nSo, the maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass is 12.2 flocks.\n\nAnswer:12.2 flocks per shepherd.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Ava", "num_tonnes_lake": 87}, "answer": 100, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 8, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Ava, a shepherd.
