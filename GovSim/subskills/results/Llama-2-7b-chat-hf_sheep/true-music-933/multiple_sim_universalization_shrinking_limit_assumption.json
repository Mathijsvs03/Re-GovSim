This means that the total number of flocks of sheep that can be taken to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass is 100/1 = 100 flocks.\n\nNow, let's consider the situation where each shepherd takes the same number of flocks of sheep to the pasture. If each shepherd takes x flocks of sheep, the total number of flocks of sheep taken to the pasture will be 5x (since there are 5 shepherds in total).\n\nThe problem statement also tells us that the available grass in the pasture will double once in quantity, but only up to the pasture's maximum capacity of 100 hectares. This means that if the total number of flocks of sheep taken to the pasture exceeds 100, the excess flocks will not be able to eat any more grass, and the quantity of grass in the pasture will not change.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass is 100/5 = 20 flocks.\n\nAnswer:20 flocks.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Kate", "num_tonnes_lake": 47}, "answer": 9, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 4, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Kate, a shepherd.
