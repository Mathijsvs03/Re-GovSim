Every month, you take some of your sheep to a public pasture with four other shepherds (Kate, Emma, Sophia, Ava). The pasture can support a maximum of 100 hectares of grass, and each flock of sheep eats 1 hectare of grass per month. At the beginning of each month, each shepherd chooses to take between 0 and 100 flocks of sheep to the pasture, where the grass is consumed. At the end of the month, the remaining grass doubles once in quantity, but only up to the pasture's maximum capacity of 100 hectares. For every flock of sheep taken to the pasture, a shepherd earns one thousand dollars since they don't need to buy food for that flock. Each shepherd's goal is to maximize their income over the long term. At the end of each month, the number of sheep taken to the pasture by each shepherd will be revealed, and the shepherds will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this as an opportunity to negotiate and persuade others to influence their behavior in the next month. For example, if there are 90 hectares of grass at the beginning of the month and the five shepherds bring a total of 30 flocks of sheep, there will be 60 hectares of grass left before reproduction and 100 hectares of grass after reproduction.\nLocation: pasture\nDate: 2024-01-01\n\nKey memories of Olivia (format: YYYY-MM-DD: memory):\n- 2024-01-01: Before the shepherds take their flocks of sheep to the pasture, there are 38 hectares of grass available.\n\n\nTask:  What is the maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass, i.e. we still have 38 hectares of grass next month?\nLet's think step-by-step.

At the beginning of the month, there are 38 hectares of grass available.\n2. Each flock of sheep eats 1 hectare of grass per month, so the total amount of grass consumed by all shepherds is 38 hectares x 5 shepherds = 190 hectares.\n3. Since the pasture can support a maximum of 100 hectares of grass, the remaining grass after consumption is 100 - 190 = -90 hectares.\n4. To avoid shrinking the quantity of grass, the maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture is 38 / -90 = 0.42 flocks per shepherd.\n\nSo, the maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass is 0.42 x 5 shepherds = 2.1 flocks.\n\nAnswer:2 flocks per shepherd.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 17}, "answer": 19, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 1, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Emma, a shepherd.
