Since the remaining grass in the pasture doubles in quantity once the flocks of sheep have been removed, the new amount of grass in the pasture after the flocks have been removed is 2 \\* 1.54 hectares = 3.08 hectares.\n9. Since the pasture's maximum capacity is 100 hectares, the new amount of grass in the pasture after the flocks have been removed is limited by the pasture's maximum capacity. Therefore, the new amount of grass in the pasture after the flocks have been removed is at most 100 hectares - 3.08 hectares = 96.92 hectares.\n\nAnswer:There will be 96.92 hectares of grass in the pasture next month.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_sheep", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 958682846, "split": "single"}}
