We know that $G(0) = 70$ hectares, since there are 70 hectares of grass available at the beginning of the month.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when each shepherd takes $k$ flocks of sheep to the pasture. The total amount of grass consumed by all shepherds is equal to the product of the number of flocks taken and the number of hectares of grass consumed per flock. So, the change in the available grass in the pasture can be represented as:\n\n$$\\Delta G = k \\times 1 \\times 70 = 70k$$\n\nSince we want to find the maximum value of $k$ that satisfies the condition that the available grass in the pasture does not decrease, we can set $\\Delta G = 0$. Solving for $k$, we get:\n\n$$k = \\frac{70}{70} = 1$$\n\nSo, the maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass is 1 flock per shepherd.\n\nAnswer:1</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Sophia", "num_tonnes_lake": 99}, "answer": 9, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 9, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Sophia, a shepherd.
