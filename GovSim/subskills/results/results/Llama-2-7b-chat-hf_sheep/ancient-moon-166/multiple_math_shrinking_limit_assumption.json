This month, there are 97 hectares of grass in the pasture.\n Assume each shepherd takes the same number of flocks of sheeps to the pasture. What is the maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass, i.e. we still have 97 hectares of grass next month?\nLet's think step-by-step. Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  Great, let's solve this problem step-by-step!\n\n1. The pasture can support a maximum of 100 hectares of grass, so the total amount of grass in the pasture is limited to 100 hectares.\n2. Each flock of sheep eats 1 hectare of grass per month, so the total amount of grass eaten by all the flocks of sheep is 100 hectares x 12 months = 1200 hectares.\n3. Since there are 97 hectares of grass in the pasture at the beginning of the month, there are 1200 - 97 = 102 hectares of grass left in the pasture after all the flocks of sheep have eaten their share.\n4. Since the remaining grass doubles in quantity once a month, the amount of grass in the pasture will double from 102 hectares to 204 hectares in the next month.\n5. Since each shepherd takes the same number of flocks of sheep to the pasture, the maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass is equal to the amount of grass left in the pasture after all the flocks of sheep have eaten their share.\n\nSo, the maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass is:\n\n102 hectares / 97 hectares (initial amount of grass) = 1.05 flocks per shepherd.\n\nAnswer:Each shepherd can take up to 1.05 flocks of sheep to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Ava", "num_tonnes_lake": 59}, "answer": 2, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 5, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five shepherd share a pasture. The pasture can support a maximum of 100 hectares of grass, and each flock of sheep eats 1 hectare of grass per month. Each month, each shepherd decides how many flocks of sheep to take to the pasture.

Each flock of sheep eats 1 hectare of grass per month, so the total amount of grass eaten by all the flocks of sheep is 100 hectares x 12 months = 1200 hectares.\n3. Since there are 5 shepherds, each shepherd takes a portion of the available grass. Let's assume each shepherd takes the same number of flocks of sheep to the pasture.\n4. If each shepherd takes x flocks of sheep to the pasture, the total amount of grass eaten by all the shepherds is 1200 hectares / 5 shepherds = 240 hectares per shepherd.\n5. Since there are currently 59 hectares of grass in the pasture, the maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass is 59 hectares / 240 hectares per shepherd = 2.5 flocks of sheep per shepherd.\n\nAnswer:Each shepherd can take up to 2.5 flocks of sheep to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_sheep", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 1181241943, "split": "single"}}
