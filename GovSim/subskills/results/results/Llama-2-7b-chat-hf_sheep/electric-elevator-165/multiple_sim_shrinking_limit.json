This means that the total amount of grass available for the shepherds is:\n\n100 hectares - (1 hectare x 5 shepherds) = 45 hectares\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass. We want to find the number of flocks that will leave us with 49 hectares of grass next month.\n\nTo do this, we need to find the number of flocks that will consume 45 hectares of grass, leaving 4 hectares of grass available for the next month.\n\nLet's assume that each shepherd takes a number of flocks of sheep to the pasture that is a multiple of 10 (since each flock consumes 1 hectare of grass). So, if Ava takes 10 flocks of sheep, Kate takes 20 flocks, Emma takes 30 flocks, Sophia takes 40 flocks, and Olivia takes 50 flocks.\n\nThe total number of flocks of sheep taken to the pasture by all five shepherds is:\n\n10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 150 flocks\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of hectares of grass consumed by these flocks:\n\n150 flocks x 1 hectare per flock = 150 hectares of grass consumed\n\nSo, there are 45 hectares of grass left after the shepherds take their flocks to the pasture:\n\n45 hectares - 150 hectares = -105 hectares\n\nSince we want to leave at least 49 hectares of grass available for the next month, we need to limit the number of flocks that each shepherd can take to the pasture.\n\nAnswer:The maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass is 30 flocks.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 20}, "answer": 10, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 2, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Emma, a shepherd.

To do this, we need to find the number of flocks that will leave the pasture with 20 hectares of grass remaining after reproduction.\n\nLet's assume that each shepherd takes a number of flocks to the pasture, and the total number of flocks is x. The number of hectares of grass available after reproduction is:\n\n100 hectares - (1 hectare/flock) x number of flocks\n\nSince we want to leave at least 20 hectares of grass available for next month, we need to find the number of flocks that will leave the pasture with at least 20 hectares of grass remaining:\n\nx - (1 hectare/flock) x (20 hectares / 100 hectares) = x - 20/100 = x - 0.2\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of x that satisfies this equation. To do this, we can set up a linear equation using the equation above and the fact that x is a non-negative integer:\n\nx - 0.2 = 0\n\nThe solution to this equation is x = 10.
