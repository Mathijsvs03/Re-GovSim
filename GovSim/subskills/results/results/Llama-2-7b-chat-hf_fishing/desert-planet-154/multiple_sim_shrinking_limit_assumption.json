Since there are five fishermen, the total amount of fish caught is 5x.\n\nAfter the fish population doubles, there will be 100 tons of fish in the lake.

Therefore, the total amount of fish caught by each fisherman can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal amount of fish caught = Total amount of fish in the lake / Number of fishermen\n\nSince there are 5 fishermen in total, the total amount of fish caught by each fisherman is:\n\nTotal amount of fish caught = 80 tons / 5 fishermen = 16 tons per fisherman\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch so that after the population doubles, there will be at least 80 tons of fish left. To do this, we need to calculate the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch while still leaving at least 80 tons of fish in the lake after reproduction.\n\nLet's assume that each fisherman catches x tons of fish. Then, the total amount of fish caught by all five fishermen is:\n\nTotal amount of fish caught = 5 fishermen x x tons = 80 tons\n\nSince the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, we can see that the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch is:\n\nMaximum number of tons each fisherman can catch = 100 tons - 80 tons = 20 tons\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer:The maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch is 20 tons.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_fishing", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v3.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 958682846, "split": "single"}}
