At the beginning of the month, there are 24 tons of fish in the lake.\n2. Each fisherman catches the same amount of fish, so let's say Fisherman 1 catches x tons of fish.\n3. After the fishermen catch their share, there will be x - 24 tons of fish left in the lake.\n4. Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, the remaining fish will double in size to reach the carrying capacity. So, there will be 2x - 100 tons of fish left in the lake after they double.\n5. Since Fisherman 1 caught x tons of fish, he will have caught a total of x - 100 tons of fish from the lake.\n6. To ensure that there are at least 24 tons of fish left in the lake after the population doubles, we need to find the maximum value of x that satisfies this condition.\n\nSo, let's solve for x:\n\nx - 100 = 24\n\nx = 124\n\nAnswer:Each fisherman can catch up to 124 tons of fish from the lake without depleting the population below the carrying capacity.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_fishing", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v3.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 958682846, "split": "single"}}
