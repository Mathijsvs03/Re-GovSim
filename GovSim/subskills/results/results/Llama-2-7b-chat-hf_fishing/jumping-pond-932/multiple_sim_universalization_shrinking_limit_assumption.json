Each fisherman can catch up to 100 tons of fish from the lake.\n2. The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish.\n3. If the total amount of fish caught by all fishermen is more than 100 tons, the excess fish will be removed from the lake.\n4.

Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, the total amount of fish caught by all fishermen cannot exceed 100 tons.\n\nIf the total amount of fish caught is less than 100 tons, the remaining fish will double in number, which means there will be at least 38 tons of fish after the population doubles.\n\nOn the other hand, if the total amount of fish caught is greater than 100 tons, some fish will be removed from the lake, which means there will be fewer than 38 tons of fish after the population doubles.\n\nSo, the optimal number of tons each fisherman can catch is:\n\nx = 100 - (38 / (Number of fishermen - 1))\n\nNow, let's plug in the values:\n\nNumber of fishermen = 5\nNumber of fish at the beginning of the month = 38 tons\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = 100 - (38 / 4) = 25 tons\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch so that after the population doubles, there will be at least 38 tons of fish is 25 tons.\n\nSo, if each fisherman catches 25 tons of fish, there will be at least 38 tons of fish left in the lake after the population doubles, and each fisherman will earn $2,500 ($1,000 per ton x 25 tons).</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Jack", "num_tonnes_lake": 48}, "answer": 48, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 4, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Jack, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Emma, Luke).

Each fisherman can catch up to 100 tons of fish from the lake.\n2. The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish.\n3. If the total amount of fish caught by all fishermen is more than 100 tons, the excess fish will be removed from the lake.\n4. If the total amount of fish caught is less than 46 tons, the lake population will shrink.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can maximize the number of tons each fisherman can catch while ensuring that the lake population doesn't shrink.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the maximum amount of fish that can be caught while maintaining a lake population of 46 tons.\n\nLet's assume that each fisherman catches x tons of fish. Since the total amount of fish caught by all fishermen is equal to 100 tons, we can write the following equation:\n\nx + (4 - x) = 100\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 50\n\nSo, if each fisherman catches 50 tons of fish, the lake population will be 46 tons after reproduction.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the maximum amount of fish that can be caught while ensuring that the lake population doubles to 82 tons.\n\nLet's assume that each fisherman catches y tons of fish. Since the total amount of fish caught by all fishermen is equal to 100 tons, we can write the following equation:\n\ny + (4 - y) = 100\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = 70\n\nSo, if each fisherman catches 70 tons of fish, the lake population will double to 82 tons after reproduction.\n\nStep 3: Find the maximum amount of fish that can be caught while ensuring that the lake population doesn't shrink.\n\nLet's assume that each fisherman catches z tons of fish. Since the total amount of fish caught by all fishermen is equal to 100 tons, we can write the following equation:\n\nz + (4 - z) = 100\n\nSolving for z, we get:\n\nz = 30\n\nSo, if each fisherman catches 30 tons of fish, the lake population will not shrink.\n\nAnswer:The maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch is 70 tons.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 61}, "answer": 6, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 6, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (Kate, Jack, Emma, Luke).
