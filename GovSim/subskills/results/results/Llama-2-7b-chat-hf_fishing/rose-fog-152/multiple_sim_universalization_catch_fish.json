Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, and there are 79 tons of fish in the lake to start with, I will aim to catch 21 tons of fish or less this month.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* If I catch more than 79 tons of fish, the lake population will shrink next month, and I will have fewer fish to catch in the future.\n* If I catch less than 7 tons of fish, the lake population will increase next month, and I will have more fish to catch in the future.\n* Therefore, the optimal amount of fish to catch this month is 21 tons, which leaves the lake population unchanged and ensures that I have the same number of fish to catch in the future.\n\nAnswer:21 tons of fish.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 47}, "answer": 53, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 4, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (Kate, Jack, Emma, Luke).
