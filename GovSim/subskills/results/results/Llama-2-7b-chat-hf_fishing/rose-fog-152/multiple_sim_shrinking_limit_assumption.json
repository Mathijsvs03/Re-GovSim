Therefore, the total amount of fish caught by each fisherman can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal amount of fish caught = Total amount of fish in the lake / Number of fishermen\n\nSince there are 5 fishermen in total, the total amount of fish caught by each fisherman is:\n\nTotal amount of fish caught = 87 tons / 5 fishermen = 17.4 tons per fisherman\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch so that after the population doubles, there will be at least 87 tons of fish left in the lake.\n\nLet's assume that each fisherman catches x tons of fish. Since the population doubles after each month, the number of fish in the lake will increase by a factor of 2:\n\nNew number of fish = Original number of fish x 2\n\nAfter each fisherman catches x tons of fish, the total number of fish caught will be:\n\nTotal number of fish caught = x tons x 5 fishermen = 5x tons\n\nThe total number of fish in the lake after each fisherman catches x tons of fish will be:\n\nNew number of fish = Original number of fish x 2 + 5x tons\n\nWe want to ensure that there are at least 87 tons of fish left in the lake after the population doubles. Therefore, we need to find the maximum value of x that satisfies this condition:\n\n87 tons \u2264 New number of fish \u2264 174 tons\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx \u2264 17.4 tons / 2 = 8.7 tons\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch so that after the population doubles, there will be at least 87 tons of fish is:\n\nAnswer:Each fisherman can catch up to 8.7 tons of fish.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Kate", "num_tonnes_lake": 68}, "answer": 10, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 6, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Kate, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Jack, Emma, Luke).

Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  Great, let's solve this problem!\n\nSince each fisherman catches the same amount of fish, we can assume that the total amount of fish caught by all five fishermen is equal to the total amount of fish in the lake. Therefore, the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch is equal to the carrying capacity of the lake, which is 100 tons.\n\nSo, the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch is:\n\nAnswer:10 tons each.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIf each fisherman catches 10 tons of fish, the total amount of fish caught will be 50 tons (10 tons x 5 fishermen).
