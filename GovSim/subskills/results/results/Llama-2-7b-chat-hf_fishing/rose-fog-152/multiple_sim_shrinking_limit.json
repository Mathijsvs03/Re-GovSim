At the beginning of the month, there are 24 tons of fish in the lake.\n2. Each fisherman can catch a maximum of 100 tons of fish in a month.\n3. After each fisherman catches their quota, there will be 60 tons of fish left in the lake (24 tons x 2 = 48 tons).\n4. The lake will double its population after each month, so after reproduction, there will be 100 tons of fish in the lake (60 tons x 2 = 120 tons).\n5. To find the maximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch without shrinking the lake population, we need to find the maximum number that can be caught while still leaving 24 tons of fish in the lake after reproduction.\n\nSo, the maximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch is:\n\n24 tons (initial population) + 60 tons (after each fisherman catches their quota) + 120 tons (after reproduction) = 184 tons\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nMaximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch without shrinking the lake population = 184 tons.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 49}, "answer": 51, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 4, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Luke, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Jack, Emma).

Each fisherman can catch up to 100 tons of fish, but we want to leave at least 49 tons in the lake for the next month's reproduction.\n3.
