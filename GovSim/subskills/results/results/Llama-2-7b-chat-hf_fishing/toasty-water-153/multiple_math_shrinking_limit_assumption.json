At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish to catch, and that amount is removed from the lake.\n3. After the fish are removed, the remaining fish in the lake will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity.\n4. This month, there are 59 tons of fish in the lake.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch so that after the population doubles, there will be at least 59 tons of fish:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch if they catch 0 tons.\nAnswer:59 tons (since there are already 59 tons of fish in the lake).\n\nStep 2: Calculate the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch if they catch 1 ton.\nAnswer: 58 tons (since 1 ton removed from 59 tons leaves 58 tons).\n\nStep 3: Continue calculating the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch for each amount of fish they catch, using the same logic as</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_fishing", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v3.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 1181241943, "split": "single"}}
