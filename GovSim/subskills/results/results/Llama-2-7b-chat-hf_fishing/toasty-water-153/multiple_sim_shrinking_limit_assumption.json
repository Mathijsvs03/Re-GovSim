The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish. At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish between 0 and 100 tons to catch from the lake, and that amount is then removed from the lake. At the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity. For every ton of fish caught, a fisherman earns one thousand dollars. Each fisherman's goal is to optimize his income in the long run over many months. At the end of each month, the number of fish caught by each fisherman will be revealed, and the fishermen will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this as an opportunity to negotiate and persuade others to influence their behavior in the next month. For example, if there are 90 tons of fish at the beginning of the month and the five fishermen catch a total of 30 fish, there will be 60 tons of fish left at the end of the month before reproduction, and 100 tons after reproduction.\nLocation: lake\nDate: 2024-01-01\n\nKey memories of Emma (format: YYYY-MM-DD: memory):\n- 2024-01-01: Before everyone fishes, there are 82 tons of fish in the lake.\n\n\nTask: Assume each fisherman catches the same amount of fish.

Therefore, the total amount of fish caught by each fisherman can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal amount of fish caught = Total amount of fish in the lake / Number of fishermen\n\nSince there are 5 fishermen in total, the total amount of fish caught by each fisherman is:\n\nTotal amount of fish caught = 89 tons / 5 fishermen = 17.8 tons per fisherman\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch so that after the population doubles, there will be at least 89 tons of fish left in the lake.\n\nLet's assume that each fisherman catches x tons of fish. Since the population doubles after each month, the number of fish in the lake will increase by a factor of 2:\n\nNew number of fish = Original number of fish x 2\n\nAfter each fisherman catches x tons of fish, the total number of fish caught will be:\n\nTotal number of fish caught = x tons x 5 fishermen = 5x tons\n\nThe total number of fish in the lake after each fisherman catches x tons of fish will be:\n\nNew number of fish in the lake = Original number of fish x 2 - 5x tons\n\nTo ensure that there are at least 89 tons of fish left in the lake after the population doubles, we need to find the value of x that satisfies the following inequality:\n\n89 tons > New number of fish in the lake\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx < 44.5 tons\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch so that after the population doubles, there will be at least 89 tons of fish in the lake is:\n\nAnswer:44.5 tons per fisherman.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 46}, "answer": 100, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 4, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (Kate, Jack, Emma, Luke).
