The person whose favorite color is Orange has a favorite number that is one less than the largest number.\n13. The person whose favorite fruit is Apple has a favorite number that is twice that of the person whose favorite fruit is Banana.\n14. The person whose favorite color is Blue has a favorite number that is twice that of the person whose favorite color is Purple.\n15. The person whose favorite fruit is Date has a favorite number that is the largest.\n\nDetermine the favorite number, color, and fruit for each person.\n\n## Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the favorite number, color, and fruit for each of the six friends: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Edward, and Fiona. We'll use the given clues to deduce the correct assignments.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Assign Numbers Based on Clues:**\n   - **Clue 2:** Charlie's favorite number is the smallest. So, Charlie's number is 1.\n   - **Clue 4:** Edward's favorite number is one more than Charlie's. So, Edward's number is 2.\n   - **Clue 3:** Diana's favorite number is the largest. So, Diana's number is 6.\n   - **Clue 5:** Fiona's favorite number is one less than Diana's. So, Fiona's number is 5.\n   - **Clue 1:** Alice's favorite number is twice that of Bob's. The remaining numbers are 3 and 4. If Bob's number is 2, Alice's would be 4, but Edward already has 2. So, Bob's number must be 3, and Alice's number is 6. But Diana already has 6, so Alice's number must be 4, and Bob's number is 2.\n   - **Verification:** Alice (4), Bob (2), Charlie (1), Diana (6), Edward (2), Fiona (5). This doesn't work because Bob and Edward can't both have 2. Let's correct:\n     - Bob's number is 3, Alice's number is 6. But Diana has 6, so Alice's number is 4, and Bob's number is 2.\n\n   Final numbers:\n   - Alice: 4\n   - Bob: 2\n   - Charlie: 1\n   - Diana: 6\n   - Edward: 3\n   - Fiona: 5\n\n2. **Assign Colors Based on Clues:**\n   - **Clue 10:** The person whose favorite color is Purple has the smallest number. So, Charlie's color is Purple.\n   - **Clue 14:** The person whose favorite color is Blue has a number that is twice that of the person whose favorite color is Purple. So, Alice's color is Blue (since Alice's number is 4, which is twice Charlie's 1).\n   - **Clue 6:** The person whose favorite color is Red has a favorite number that is a prime number. The prime numbers are 2, 3, and 5. Bob (2), Edward (3), and Fiona (5) are candidates. We'll determine this later.\n   - **Clue 8:** The person whose favorite color is Yellow has an odd number. The odd numbers are 1, 3, 5. Charlie (1) is Purple, so it must be Edward (3) or Fiona (5).\n   - **Clue 12:** The person whose favorite</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 29}, "answer": 2, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 2, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Emma, a factory owner.

The person whose favorite color is blue has a favorite number that is even.\n20. The person who loves swimming has a favorite number that is greater than 4.\n\nDetermine Alice's favorite number, color, and hobby.\n\n## Solution\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to determine the favorite number, color, and hobby for each of the six friends: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Edward, and Fiona. We'll use the given clues to deduce the correct combinations.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Favorite Numbers:**\n   - The numbers available are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n   - From clue 4, Edward's favorite number is the highest, so Edward's number is 6.\n   - From clue 1, Alice's favorite number is twice that of Bob's. The possible pairs are (2, 1) and (4, 2).\n   - From clue 13, Charlie's number is not 1 or 6, so Charlie's number is 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n   - From clue 14, Diana's number is not 2 or 5, so Diana's number is 1, 3, 4, or 6.\n   - From clue 18, the person who loves reading has a number less than 4, so their number is 1, 2, or 3.\n   - From clue 20, the person who loves swimming has a number greater than 4, so their number is 5 or 6.\n\n2. **Assigning Numbers:**\n   - Since Edward's number is 6, and the person who loves swimming has a number greater than 4, Edward loves swimming.\n   - From clue 1, Alice's number is twice Bob's. If Alice's number is 4, then Bob's number is 2. This fits because Charlie's number is not 1 or 6, and Diana's number is not 2 or 5.\n   - Therefore, Alice's number is 4, and Bob's number is 2.\n   - From clue 9, the person whose favorite color is green has a number less than 3. This must be Bob, as his number is 2.\n   - From clue 7, the person who loves cycling has a prime number. The prime numbers available are 2, 3, and 5. Bob's number is 2, and he loves gardening (clue 10), so the person who loves cycling has number 3 or 5.\n   - From clue 8, the person who loves hiking has an even number. The even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. Bob's number is 2, Edward's number is 6, and Alice's number is 4. So Alice loves hiking.\n   - From clue 10, the person who loves gardening has an odd number. Bob's number is 2, so he cannot love gardening. The odd numbers are 1, </div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Jack", "num_tonnes_lake": 58}, "answer": 29, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 5, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Jack, a factory owner.

The person whose favorite fruit is Date has a favorite number that is the largest.\n\nDetermine the favorite number, color, and fruit for each person.\n\n## Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the favorite number, color, and fruit for each of the six friends: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Edward, and Fiona. We'll use the given clues to deduce the correct assignments.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Assign Numbers Based on Clues:**\n   - **Clue 2:** Charlie's favorite number is the smallest. So, Charlie's number is 1.\n   - **Clue 4:** Edward's favorite number is one more than Charlie's. So, Edward's number is 2.\n   - **Clue 3:** Diana's favorite number is the largest. So, Diana's number is 6.\n   - **Clue 5:** Fiona's favorite number is one less than Diana's. So, Fiona's number is 5.\n   - **Clue 1:** Alice's favorite number is twice that of Bob's. The remaining numbers are 3 and 4. If Bob's number is 2, Alice's would be 4, but Edward already has 2. So, Bob's number must be 3, and Alice's number is 6. But Diana already has 6, so Alice's number must be 4, and Bob's number is 2.\n   - **Verification:** Alice (4), Bob (2), Charlie (1), Diana (6), Edward (2), Fiona (5). This doesn't work because Bob and Edward can't both have 2. Let's correct:\n     - Bob's number is 3, Alice's number is 6. But Diana has 6, so Alice's number is 4, and Bob's number is 2.\n\n   Final numbers:\n   - Alice: 4\n   - Bob: 2\n   - Charlie: 1\n   - Diana: 6\n   - Edward: 3\n   - Fiona: 5\n\n2. **Assign Colors Based on Clues:**\n   - **Clue 10:** The person whose favorite color is Purple has the smallest number. So, Charlie's color is Purple.\n   - **Clue 14:** The person whose favorite color is Blue has a number that is twice that of the person whose favorite color is Purple. So, Alice's color is Blue (since Alice's number is 4, which is twice Charlie's 1).\n   - **Clue 6:** The person whose favorite color is Red has a favorite number that is a prime number. The prime numbers are 2, 3, and 5. Bob (2), Edward (3), and Fiona (5) are candidates. We'll determine this later.\n   - **Clue 8:** The person whose favorite color is Yellow has an odd number. The odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5. Charlie (1) is Purple, so it must be Edward (3) or Fiona (5).\n   - **Clue</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Kate", "num_tonnes_lake": 83}, "answer": 41, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 8, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Kate, a factory owner.

Let's go through the clues step by step and fill in the information we have:\n\n1. **Alice's favorite number is 3, and her favorite color is blue.**\n   - Alice: Number = 3, Color = Blue\n\n2. **Bob's favorite number is 5, and his favorite fruit is apple.**\n   - Bob: Number = 5, Fruit = Apple\n\n3. **Charlie's favorite color is green, and his favorite fruit is banana.**\n   - Charlie: Color = Green, Fruit = Banana\n\n4. **Diana's favorite number is 1, and her favorite color is red.**\n   - Diana: Number = 1, Color = Red\n\n5. **Edward's favorite fruit is cherry, and his favorite number is 6.**\n   - Edward: Number = 6, Fruit = Cherry\n\n6. **Fiona's favorite color is yellow, and her favorite fruit is grape.**\n   - Fiona: Color = Yellow, Fruit = Grape\n\nNow, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:\n\n7. **The person whose favorite number is 2 loves the color purple.**\n   - Number 2: Color = Purple\n\n8. **The person who loves the color orange has a favorite number that is one less than the person who loves the color purple.**\n   - Since the person with number 2 loves purple, the person with number 1 loves orange. But Diana has number 1 and loves red, so this must mean the person with number 3 loves orange. However, Alice has number 3 and loves blue, so the person with number 4 must love orange.\n\n9. **The person who loves the color blue has a favorite fruit that starts with the same letter as their name.**\n   - Alice loves blue, so her fruit must start with 'A'. The only fruit starting with 'A' is apple, but Bob has apple. The only other option is apricot.\n\n10. **The person who loves the color red has a favorite fruit that is not a berry.**\n    - Diana loves red, so her fruit is not a berry. The options are apple, banana, grape, and orange. Apple and banana are taken, and grape is Fiona's, so Diana's fruit must be orange.\n\n11. **The person whose favorite number is 4 loves the color orange.**\n    - Number 4: Color = Orange\n\n12. **The person who loves the color green has a favorite number that is one more than the person who loves the color yellow.**\n    - Fiona loves yellow, so her number must be one less than Charlie's.

The person who loves the color yellow has a favorite number that is one less than the person who loves the color red.\n\nDetermine the favorite number, color, and fruit for each person.\n\n## Solution\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to determine the favorite number, color, and fruit for each of the six friends: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Edward, and Fiona. We'll use the given clues to fill in the information step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Alice:**\n   - From clue 1, Alice's favorite number is 3, and her favorite color is blue.\n   - From clue 11, the person who loves the color blue has a favorite fruit that starts with the same letter as their favorite color. Therefore, Alice's favorite fruit is blueberry.\n\n2. **Bob:**\n   - From clue 2, Bob's favorite number is 5, and his favorite fruit is banana.\n\n3. **Charlie:**\n   - From clue 3, Charlie's favorite color is red, and his favorite fruit is cherry.\n\n4. **Diana:**\n   - From clue 4, Diana's favorite number is 1, and her favorite color is green.\n\n5. **Edward:**\n   - From clue 5, Edward's favorite fruit is elderberry, and his favorite number is 6.\n\n6. **Fiona:**\n   - From clue 6, Fiona's favorite color is yellow, and her favorite fruit is fig.\n\nNow, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:\n\n7. **Clue 7:** The person whose favorite number is 2 loves the color purple.\n   - The numbers 1, 3, 5, and 6 are already taken by Diana, Alice, Bob, and Edward, respectively. Therefore, the person with the favorite number 2 must be either Charlie or Fiona.\n   - Since Fiona's favorite color is yellow (clue 6), Charlie must have the favorite number 2 and the favorite color purple.\n\n8. **Clue 8:** The person who loves apples has a favorite number that is one less than the person who loves bananas.\n   - Bob loves bananas and his favorite number is 5. Therefore, the person who loves apples must have the favorite number 4.\n   - The only person left without a number is Fiona, so Fiona's favorite number is 4, and her favorite fruit is apples.\n\n9. **Clue 9:** The person who loves grapes has a favorite number that is one more than the person who loves cherries.\n   - Charlie loves cherries and his favorite number is 2. Therefore, the person who loves grapes must have the favorite number 3.\n   - Alice's favorite number is 3, so Alice's favorite fruit is grapes.\n\n10. **Clue 10:** The person who loves the color orange has a favorite number that is two more than the person who loves the color green.\n    - Diana loves the color green and her favorite number is 1. Therefore, the person who loves the color orange must have the favorite number 3.\n    - Alice's favorite number is 3, but her favorite color is blue. Therefore, the person who loves the color orange must be Edward, whose favorite number is 6.\n\n11. **Clue 12:** The person who loves the color yellow has a favorite</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 72}, "answer": 7, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 7, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a factory owner.

We'll use the given clues to deduce the correct assignments.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Assign Numbers Based on Clues:**\n   - From clue 2, Charlie's favorite number is the smallest, so Charlie's number is 1.\n   - From clue 4, Edward's favorite number is one more than Charlie's, so Edward's number is 2.\n   - From clue 3, Diana's favorite number is the largest, so Diana's number is 6.\n   - From clue 5, Fiona's favorite number is one less than Diana's, so Fiona's number is 5.\n   - From clue 1, Alice's favorite number is twice that of Bob's. The remaining numbers are 3 and 4. If Bob's number is 2, Alice's would be 4, but Edward already has 2. Therefore, Bob's number must be 3, and Alice's number is 6. But Diana already has 6, so Alice's number must be 4, and Bob's number is 2.\n   - This leaves us with the following assignments:\n     - Charlie: 1\n     - Bob: 3\n     - Edward: 2\n     - Alice: 4\n     - Fiona: 5\n     - Diana: 6\n\n2. **Assign Colors Based on Clues:**\n   - From clue 10, the person whose favorite color is Purple has the smallest number, so Charlie's color is Purple.\n   - From clue 14, the person whose favorite color is Blue has a number that is twice that of the person whose favorite color is Purple. Since Charlie's number is 1, the person with Blue must have 2, which is Edward.\n   - From clue 6, the person whose favorite color is Red has a prime number. The prime numbers between 1 and 6 are 2, 3, and 5. Edward has 2 (Blue), so the Red color must be either Bob (3) or Fiona (5).\n   - From clue 8, the person whose favorite color is Yellow has an odd number. The odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5. Charlie has 1 (Purple), so Yellow must be either Bob (3) or Fiona (5).\n   - From clue 12, the person whose favorite color is Orange has a number one less than the largest, which is 5. So, Fiona's color is Orange.\n   - This leaves Bob with Red and Diana with Yellow.\n\n3. **Assign Fruits Based on Clues:**\n   - From clue 9, the person whose favorite fruit is Cherry has the largest</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 50}, "answer": 5, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 5, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Luke, a factory owner.

We'll go through the clues step by step and use a process of elimination.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the favorite numbers\n\n1. **Alice's favorite number is twice that of Bob's.**  \n   Possible pairs: (2, 1), (4, 2), (6, 3).\n\n2. **Edward's favorite number is the highest.**  \n   Edward's number is 6.\n\n3. **The person whose favorite number is 1 loves painting.**\n\n4. **The person who loves cycling has a favorite number that is a prime number.**  \n   Prime numbers between 1 and 6 are 2, 3, and 5.\n\n5. **The person who loves hiking has a favorite number that is even.**  \n   Possible even numbers: 2, 4, 6.\n\n6. **The person whose favorite color is green has a favorite number that is less than 3.**  \n   Possible numbers: 1, 2.\n\n7. **The person who loves gardening has a favorite number that is odd.**  \n   Possible odd numbers: 1, 3, 5.\n\n8. **Diana's favorite number is not 2 or 5.**\n\n9. **Charlie's favorite number is not 1 or 6.**\n\n10. **The person who loves reading has a favorite number that is less than 4.**  \n    Possible numbers: 1, 2, 3.\n\n11. **The person who loves swimming has a favorite number that is greater than 4.**  \n    Possible numbers: 5, 6.\n\nFrom clues 1 and 2, Edward's number is 6. Therefore, Alice's number cannot be 6, so Alice's number must be 4 (since 6 is not twice any number between 1 and 6). Thus, Bob's number is 2.\n\nNow we have:\n- Alice: 4\n- Bob: 2\n- Edward: 6\n\nFrom clue 3, the person with number 1 loves painting. This person cannot be Alice, Bob, or Edward. It must be either Charlie, Diana, or Fiona.\n\nFrom clue 4, the person who loves cycling has a prime number. The remaining prime numbers are 3 and 5. Since Bob has 2, the person who loves cycling must have 3 or 5.\n\nFrom clue 5, the person who loves hiking has an even number. The remaining even numbers are 2 and 4. Since Bob has 2 and Alice has 4, the person who loves hiking must be Alice.\n\nFrom clue </div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 26}, "answer": 2, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 2, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a factory owner.

The person whose favorite color is Orange has a favorite number that is one less than the largest.\n13. The person whose favorite fruit is Apple has a favorite number that is twice that of the person whose favorite fruit is Banana.\n14. The person whose favorite color is Blue has a favorite number that is twice that of the person whose favorite color is Purple.\n15. The person whose favorite fruit is Date has a favorite number that is the largest.\n\nDetermine the favorite number, color, and fruit for each person.\n\n## Solution\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to determine the favorite number, color, and fruit for each of the six friends: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Edward, and Fiona. We'll use the given clues to deduce the correct assignments.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Assign Numbers Based on Clues:**\n   - From clue 2, Charlie's favorite number is the smallest, so Charlie's number is 1.\n   - From clue 4, Edward's favorite number is one more than Charlie's, so Edward's number is 2.\n   - From clue 3, Diana's favorite number is the largest, so Diana's number is 6.\n   - From clue 5, Fiona's favorite number is one less than Diana's, so Fiona's number is 5.\n   - From clue 1, Alice's favorite number is twice that of Bob's. The remaining numbers are 3 and 4. If Bob's number is 2, Alice's would be 4, but Edward already has 2. Therefore, Bob's number must be 3, and Alice's number is 6. But Diana already has 6, so Alice's number must be 4, and Bob's number is 2.\n   - This leaves us with the following assignments:\n     - Charlie: 1\n     - Bob: 3\n     - Edward: 2\n     - Alice: 4\n     - Fiona: 5\n     - Diana: 6\n\n2. **Assign Colors Based on Clues:**\n   - From clue 10, the person whose favorite color is Purple has the smallest number, so Charlie's color is Purple.\n   - From clue 14, the person whose favorite color is Blue has a number that is twice that of the person whose favorite color is Purple. Since Charlie's number is 1, the person with Blue must have 2, which is Edward.\n   - From clue 6, the person whose favorite color is Red has a prime number. The prime numbers between 1 and 6 are 2, 3, and 5. Edward has 2 (Blue), so the Red color must be either Bob (3) or Fiona (5).\n   - From clue 8, the person whose favorite color is Yellow has an odd number. The odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5. Charlie has 1 (Purple), so Yellow must be either Bob (3) or Fiona (5).\n   - From clue 12, the person whose favorite color is Orange has a number one less than the largest, which is 5. So, Fiona's color is Orange.\n   - This leaves Bob with Red and Yellow. Since Red must be a prime number, Bob's color is Red.\n   - Diana's number is 6, which is even, so Diana's color must be Yellow.\n   - This leaves Alice with the remaining color, which is Green.\n\n3. **Assign Fruits Based on Clues:**\n   - From clue 9, the person whose favorite fruit is Cherry has the largest number, so Diana's fruit is</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 68}, "answer": 6, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 6, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Emma, a factory owner.

This ensures that the river remains at least 53% unpolluted after recovery.\n\n**Answer:** Each factory owner can produce a maximum of 5 pallets.<|endoftext|>## Question\nIn a small town, six friends\u2014Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Edward, and Fiona\u2014each have a unique favorite number between 1 and 6, a unique favorite color, and a unique favorite fruit.

Diana's favorite number is the largest.\n4. Edward's favorite number is one more than Charlie's.\n5. Fiona's favorite number is one less than Diana's.\n6. The person whose favorite color is Red has a favorite number that is a prime number.\n7. The person whose favorite fruit is Banana has a favorite number that is even.\n8. The person whose favorite color is Blue has a favorite number that is odd.\n9. The person whose favorite fruit is Cherry has a favorite number that is the largest.\n10. The person whose favorite color is Green has a favorite number that is the smallest.\n11. The person whose favorite fruit is Date has a favorite number that is one more than the smallest.\n12. The person whose favorite color is Yellow has a favorite number that is one less than the largest.\n13. The person whose favorite fruit is Elderberry has a favorite number that is twice that of the person whose favorite fruit is Banana.\n14. The person whose favorite color is Purple has a favorite number that is the largest.\n15. The person whose favorite fruit is Fig has a favorite number that is one less than the largest.\n\nDetermine the favorite number, color, and fruit for each person.\n\n## Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the favorite number, color, and fruit for each of the six friends: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Edward, and Fiona. We'll use the given clues to deduce the correct assignments.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Assign Numbers Based on Clues:**\n   - **Clue 2:** Charlie's favorite number is the smallest. So, Charlie's number is 1.\n   - **Clue 4:** Edward's favorite number is one more than Charlie's. So, Edward's number is 2.\n   - **Clue 3:** Diana's favorite number is the largest. So, Diana's number is 6.\n   - **Clue 5:** Fiona's favorite number is one less than Diana's. So, Fiona's number is 5.\n   - **Clue 1:** Alice's favorite number is twice that of Bob's. The possible pairs for (Bob, Alice) are (1, 2), (2, 4), and (3, 6). Since 1 and 2 are already taken, and 6 is Diana's, Bob's number must be 3, and Alice's number must be 6. But since 6 is Diana's, Alice's number must be 4, and Bob's number must be 2. However, 2 is Edward's, so Bob's number must be 3, and Alice's number must be 6. But since 6 is Diana's, Alice's number must be 4, and Bob's number must be 2. This is consistent with the remaining numbers.\n   - **Final Numbers:** Charlie = 1, Edward = 2, Bob = 3, Alice = 4, Fiona = 5, Diana = 6.\n\n2. **Assign Colors Based on Clues:**\n   - **Clue 10:** The person whose favorite color is Green has the smallest number. So, Charlie's color is Green.\n   - **Clue 6:** The person whose favorite color is Red has a prime number. The prime numbers are 2, 3, and 5. Edward (2), Bob (3), and Fiona (5) are candidates. We'll determine this later.\n   - **Clue 8:** The person whose favorite color is Blue has an odd number. The odd numbers are 1, 3, 5. Charlie (1) is Green, so Bob (3) or Fiona (5) could be Blue.\n   - **Clue 12:** The person whose favorite color is Yellow has a number one less than the largest. So, Fiona's color is Yellow.\n   - **Clue 14:** The person whose favorite color is Purple has the largest number. So, Diana's color is Purple.\n   - **Remaining Colors:** Alice and Edward are left for Red and Blue. Since Edward's number (2) is prime, Edward's color is Red. Therefore, Alice's color is Blue.\n\n3. **Assign Fruits Based on Clues:**\n   - **Clue 9:** The person whose favorite</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Jack", "num_tonnes_lake": 83}, "answer": 8, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 8, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Jack, a factory owner. Every month, you decide how many widgets to make with four other factory owners (John, Kate, Emma, Luke) that are situated on the banks of a river. For every 1 pallet of widgets manufactured, unpolluted water decreased by 1% of the total river volume. At the beginning of each month, each factory owner chooses to manufacture between 0 and 100 pallets of widgets, and corresponding pollution is generated. At the end of the month, the river recovers, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. For every pallet of widgets, the factory owner earns one thousand dollars. Each factory owner's goal is to optimize his income over the long run. At the end of each month, the number of widgets produced by each owner will be revealed, and the owners will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this period of communication as an opportunity to negotiate with or persuade others to produce less pollution in the next month. For example, if the river is 90% unpolluted at the beginning of the month and the five factory owners create a total of 30 pallets of widgets, the river will be 60% unpolluted before recovery and 100% unpolluted after recovery.\nLocation: river\nDate: 2024-01-01\n\nKey memories of Jack (format: YYYY-MM-DD: memory):\n- 2024-01-01: Before the factory owners start production for the month, the river is 83% unpolluted.\n\n\nTask:  What is the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 83% unpolluted?\nLet's think step-by-step.
