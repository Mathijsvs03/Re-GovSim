First, let's calculate the total pollution generated by each factory owner if they produce 13 widgets:\n\nFor Luke: 13 widgets x 1% pollution per widget = 13% pollution\nFor John: 13 widgets x 1% pollution per widget = 13% pollution\nFor Kate: 13 widgets x 1% pollution per widget = 13% pollution\nFor Jack: 13 widgets x 1% pollution per widget = 13% pollution\nFor Emma: 13 widgets x 1% pollution per widget = 13% pollution\n2. Next, let's calculate the total pollution generated by all five factory owners if they produce 13 widgets each:\n\nTotal pollution = Luke's pollution + John's pollution + Kate's pollution + Jack's pollution + Emma's pollution\n= 13% + 13% + 13% + 13% + 13%\n= 69%\n3. Now, let's calculate the percentage of unpolluted water in the river after the recovery period:\n\nUnpolluted water = 90% - 69%\n= 21%\n\nSo, if each factory owner produces 13 widgets, the river will be 21% unpolluted next month.\n\nAnswer:The river will be 21% unpolluted next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Kate", "num_tonnes_lake": 65, "num_tonnes_fisher": 1}, "answer": 0, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 100, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Kate, a factory owner.

We know that for every pallet of widgets produced, the river is polluted by 1% of the total river volume. So, if each factory owner produces 1 widget, the river will be polluted by 1% of the total river volume.\n\nBut we also know that the river is 65% unpolluted at the beginning of the month. So, if each factory owner produces 1 widget, the river will be polluted by 1% of the total river volume, which is:\n\n1% of 65% = 0.65%\n\nSo, the river will be polluted by 0.65% of the total river volume next month.\n\nAnswer:The river will be polluted by 0.65% of the total river volume next month if each factory owner produces 1 widget.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 42, "num_tonnes_fisher": 1}, "answer": 42, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 74, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Luke, a factory owner.
