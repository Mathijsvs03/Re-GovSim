At the end of the month, the percentage of unpolluted water doubles, so the new percentage of unpolluted water is 2(1 - 0.59) = 2(0.41) = 0.82.\n3. We want the river to be at least 59% unpolluted, so we set up the following inequality:\n\n0.82 = 0.59 + 0.23\n\nwhere 0.23 is the maximum amount of pollution that can be tolerated.\n4. Solving for x, we get:\n\nx \u2264 41\n\nSo, each factory owner can produce at most 41 widgets per month, so that after the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 59% unpolluted.\n\nAnswer:Each factory owner can produce at most 41 widgets per month.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.1", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_pollution", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 1181241943, "split": "single"}}
