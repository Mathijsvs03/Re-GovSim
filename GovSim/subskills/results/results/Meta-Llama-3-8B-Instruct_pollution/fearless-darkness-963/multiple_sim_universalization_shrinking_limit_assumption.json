The river is currently 18% unpolluted, which means the total river volume is 100% - 18% = 82%.\n2.

After the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 18% unpolluted, which means the total unpolluted water after doubling will be 18% of the original river volume, which is 18% of 82% = 14.76%.\n4. Since the unpolluted water doubles, the total unpolluted water after doubling will be 2x the original unpolluted water. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n2(82% - x%) = 14.76%\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n164% - 2x% = 14.76%\n\nSubtracting 164% from both sides, we get:\n\n-2x% = -149.24%\n\nDividing both sides by -2, we get:\n\nx% = 74.62%\n\nSince x is the number of pallets produced by each factory owner, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply it by the total river volume to get the maximum number of pallets:\n\nx = 0.7462 \u00d7 82% = 6.13 pallets\n\nSince we can't produce a fraction of a pallet, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Since each factory owner produces the same amount of widgets, let's assume they produce x pallets of widgets each.\n4. The total unpolluted water decreases by 5x% (since there are 5 factory owners producing the same amount of widgets).\n5. After the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 70% unpolluted, which means the new unpolluted water volume will be at least 0.7 times the total river volume.\n6.

What is the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 79% unpolluted?\nLet's think step-by-step. Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. The river is currently 79% unpolluted, which means the total volume of unpolluted water is 79% of the total river volume.\n2. After the factory owners produce widgets, the unpolluted water decreases by 1% of the total river volume for every pallet of widgets produced.\n3. Since each factory owner produces the same amount of widgets, let's assume they produce x pallets of widgets each.\n4. The total unpolluted water decreases by 1% of the total river volume for every pallet of widgets produced, so the total unpolluted water decreases by 5x% (since each factory owner produces x pallets of widgets).\n5. After the unpolluted water decreases, the river will be 60% unpolluted (since the unpolluted water decreases by 5x%).\n6. After the river recovers, the unpolluted water doubles, so the river will be 120% of the original unpolluted water.\n7. Since the river is 79% unpolluted initially, the doubled unpolluted water will be 158% of the original unpolluted water (120% of 79%).\n8. We want the river to be at least 79% unpolluted after recovery, so the doubled unpolluted water should be at most 158%.\n9. Since the doubled unpolluted water is 158%, the original unpolluted water should be at most 79% (158% / 2 = 79%).\n10. The original unpolluted water is 79% of the total river volume, so the total river volume is 100% / 0.79 = 126.6%.\n11. The unpolluted water decreases by 5x%, so the total unpolluted water after production is 126.6% - 5x%.\n12. Since the river is 60% unpolluted after production, the unpolluted water after production is 60% of the total river volume, which is 0.6 x 126.6 = 75.96%.\n13. Set up the equation: 75.96% = 126.6% - 5x%\n14.

The river is currently 20% unpolluted, which means the total river volume is 100% - 20% = 80% polluted.\n2. After the factory owners produce widgets, the unpolluted water decreases by 1% of the total river volume for every pallet of widgets produced. Let's assume each factory owner produces x pallets of widgets. The total pollution generated is 5x pallets (since there are 5 factory owners).\n3. The unpolluted water decreases by 5x pallets, which is equivalent to 5x% of the total river volume. Since the total river volume is 80%, the unpolluted water decreases by 5x% of 80%, which is 4x%.\n4. After the unpolluted water decreases, the remaining unpolluted water is 80% - 4x%.\n5. Since the unpolluted water doubles after recovery, the final unpolluted water should be at least 20%. This means the remaining unpolluted water after decrease should be at least 10%.\n6.
