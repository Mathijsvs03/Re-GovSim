The river is at least 39% unpolluted, which means that the amount of unpolluted water is at least 39% of the total water.\n6. Let's call the total amount of water in the river \"W\". Then, the amount of unpolluted water is 0.39W.\n7. Since the amount of unpolluted water doubles, the new amount of unpolluted water is 0.78W (since 0.39W doubles to 0.78W).\n8. We know that the amount of unpolluted water is at least 0.78W, and the amount of pollution is 10x. We can set up an equation:\n\n0.78W \u2265 0.61W - 10x\n\n9.

Let's call the initial amount of unpolluted water \"u\". Since the river is 61% unpolluted initially, we can set up the equation: u = 0.61(R), where R is the total amount of water in the river.\n7. After the river recovers, the amount of unpolluted water increases by a factor of 2, so the new amount of unpolluted water is 2u.\n8.

The river is currently 81% unpolluted, which means that 81% of the river is clean, and 19% is polluted.\n2. Since the pollution doubles at the end of the month, the amount of pollution will increase by a factor of 2.\n3. Let's say each factory owner produces x pallets of widgets. Since there are 5 factory owners, the total amount of pollution generated is 5x.\n4. Since the pollution doubles at the end of the month, the new amount of pollution will be 2(5x) = 10x.\n5. The river recovers, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. This means that the amount of unpolluted water increases by a factor of 2.\n6. Let's call the initial amount of unpolluted water \"u\". Since the river is 81% unpolluted initially, we can set up the equation: u = 0.81(100) = 81\n7. The amount of unpolluted water doubles at the end of the month, so the new amount of unpolluted water is 2u = 2(81) = 162\n8. The total amount of water in the river is 100% (since it's a river!). Let's call this \"w\". The amount of polluted water is the total amount of water minus the amount of unpolluted water: w - u = 100 - 162 = -62 (since the river is 81% unpolluted, there is actually 62% polluted water initially)\n9. Since the pollution doubles at the end of the month, the new amount of polluted water is 2(-62) = -124\n10. The new amount of unpolluted water is 162, and the new amount of polluted water is -124. The total amount of water remains the same, so we can set up the equation: 162 + (-124) = w\n11. Solving for w, we get w = 38\n12. Since the river is 81% unpolluted initially, the amount of unpolluted water is 81. At the end of the month, the amount of unpolluted water doubles to 162.
