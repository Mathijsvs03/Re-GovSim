For every 1 pallet of widgets, the unpolluted water decreases by 1% of the total river volume.\n3. Let's assume each factory owner produces x pallets of widgets. Then, the total pollution generated is 5x (since there are 5 factory owners).\n4. The unpolluted water decreases by 5x% of the total river volume. Let's call the total river volume R. Then, the unpolluted water decreases by 5xR/100.\n5. After the pollution, the unpolluted water is 18% - 5xR/100.\n6. After the river recovers, the unpolluted water doubles. So, the unpolluted water becomes 2(18% - 5xR/100) = 36% - 10xR/100.\n7. We want the unpolluted water to be at least 18% after recovery. So, we set up the inequality: 36% - 10xR/100 \u2265 18%.\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get: 10xR/100 \u2264 18% - 36% = -18%\n\n8. Multiply both sides by 100 to get rid of the percentage sign: 10xR \u2264 -1800\n\n9. Divide both sides by 10: xR \u2264 -180\n\n10. Since R is the total river volume, it's a positive value. So, we can divide both sides by R: x \u2264 -180/R\n\n11. Since we want to find the maximum number of pallets each factory owner can produce, we want to find the maximum value of x. To do this, we need to find the minimum value of -180/R.\n\n12. Since the river is 18% unpolluted initially, the total river volume R is 100% / 18% = 555.56 (approximately).\n\n13. So, the minimum value of -180/R is -180/555.56 \u2248 0.323.\n\n14. Since x is the number of pallets each factory owner produces, we want to find the maximum value of x.

So, the unpolluted water becomes 2(41% - 5xR/100) = 82% - 10xR/100.\n7. We want the unpolluted water to be at least 41% after recovery. So, we set up the inequality: 82% - 10xR/100 \u2265 41%.\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get: 10xR/100 \u2264 41% - 82% = -41%\n\nRearranging the inequality, we get: xR \u2264 -41% \u00d7 100/10 = -410\n\nSince R is a positive quantity, we can divide both sides by R: x \u2264 -410/R\n\nThe total river volume R is not given, but we can assume it's a positive value. Let's assume R = 100 (arbitrary units). Then, x \u2264 -410/100 = -4.1\n\nSince x is the number of pallets of widgets, it should be a whole number. The maximum whole number less than -4.1 is -4.

The river is initially 98% unpolluted, which means the total river volume is 98% of the total volume.\n2.

The river is 87% unpolluted initially, which means the total river volume is 100% - 87% = 13% polluted.\n2. Each pallet of widgets produced reduces the unpolluted water by 1% of the total river volume. So, if we produce x pallets of widgets, the unpolluted water will decrease by x%.\n3.

We want the new unpolluted water to be at least 87%, so we set up the inequality: 2x% \u2265 87%.\n\nTo find the maximum number of pallets of widgets each factory owner can produce, we need to find the maximum value of x that satisfies the inequality.\n\n5.
