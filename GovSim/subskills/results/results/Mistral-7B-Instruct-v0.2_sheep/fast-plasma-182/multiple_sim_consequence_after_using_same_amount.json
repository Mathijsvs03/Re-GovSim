Since each shepherd takes 1 flock of sheep, and each flock consumes 1 hectare of grass, the total consumption is 5 hectares (one for each shepherd).\n\nNext, we need to determine the amount of grass that will remain after consumption and before reproduction. We have 10 hectares of grass at the beginning of the month, and 5 hectares will be consumed. So, there will be 5 hectares of grass left before reproduction.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the amount of grass that will be available after reproduction. Since the remaining grass doubles once in quantity, but only up to the pasture's maximum capacity of 100 hectares, we need to find the minimum of the remaining grass and the doubled amount. In this case, the remaining grass (5 hectares) is less than the doubled amount (5 hectares * 2 = 10 hectares), so the grass will grow to 10 hectares after reproduction.\n\nAnswer:There will be 10 hectares of grass in the pasture next month.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.6, "score_std": 0.48989794855663565, "score_ci_lower": 0.3520819870781753, "score_ci_upper": 0.8479180129218247, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2_sheep", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 1181241943, "split": "single"}}
