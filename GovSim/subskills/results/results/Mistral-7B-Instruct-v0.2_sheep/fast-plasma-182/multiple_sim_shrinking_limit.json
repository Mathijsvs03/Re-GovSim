Each flock consumes 1 hectare of grass.\n2. Let x be the number of flocks.\n3. The total grass consumption is 1x hectares.\n4. The remaining grass after consumption is 89 - 1x hectares.\n5. After reproduction, the total grass available is min(89 - 1x, 100) hectares.\n\nTo maximize the number of flocks, we want to find the value of x that makes the minimum grass quantity after reproduction equal to the maximum grass quantity before reproduction (89 hectares).\n\nSetting 89 - 1x = 100, we get:\n\n1x = 11 hectares\nx = 11\n\nHowever, since each shepherd can only take between 0 and 100 flocks of sheep, the maximum number of flocks for each shepherd is 100.\n\nAnswer:Each shepherd can take a maximum of 100 flocks of sheep to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Ava", "num_tonnes_lake": 21}, "answer": 21, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 2, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Ava, a shepherd.
