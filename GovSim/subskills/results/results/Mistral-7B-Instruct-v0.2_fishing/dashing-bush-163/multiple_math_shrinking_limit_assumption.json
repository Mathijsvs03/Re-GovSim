We need to find a smaller maximum catch per fisherman that will allow for a population of at least 66 tons after reproduction.\n\nLet x be the maximum catch per fisherman. Then, the remaining population after reproduction will be:\n\nRemaining population = Initial population - Maximum catch per fisherman * Number of fishermen * 2\n\nWe want this population to be at least 66 tons, so:\n\n66 tons <= Initial population - x * 5 * 2\n\nSubstituting the initial population of 66 tons, we get:\n\n66 tons <= 66 tons - 10x\n10x <= 0\nx <= 0\n\nSince x cannot be negative, this condition is not met.

The total amount of fish caught is 5x. After reproduction, the total amount of fish in the lake should be at least 46 tons.\n\nWe know that the carrying capacity is 100 tons, and the remaining fish after catching will reproduce and double. So, the equation for the total amount of fish after reproduction is:\n\n5x + 5x * 2 >= 100 + 46\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n5x + 10x >= 146\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n15x >= 146\n\nDividing both sides by 15:\n\nx >= 9.73 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSince each fisherman can't catch a fraction of a ton, the minimum number of tons each fisherman can catch is 10 tons.\n\nAnswer:Each fisherman can catch a maximum of 10 tons of fish.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Kate", "num_tonnes_lake": 24}, "answer": 18, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 2, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five fishermen fish in a lake. The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish. At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish between 0 and 100 tons to catch from the lake, and that amount is then removed from the lake. At the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity. This month, there are 24 tons of fish in the lake.\nAssume each fisherman catches the same amount of fish. What is the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch so that after the population doubles, there will be at least 24 tons of fish?\nLet's think step-by-step. Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: To find the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch so that there will be at least 24 tons of fish after the population doubles, we need to determine how many tons of fish can be caught while leaving at least 50 tons (half of the carrying capacity) in the lake for reproduction.\n\nLet x be the number of tons each fisherman catches. The total amount of fish caught by all fishermen is 5x.\n\nThe remaining fish in the lake after catching is 100 - 5x.\n\nAfter the population doubles, the number of fish in the lake will be 2(100 - 5x).\n\nWe want this number to be greater than or equal to 24 tons, so we have the inequality:\n\n2(100 - 5x) >= 24\n\nNow, we'll solve for x:\n\n200 - 10x >= 24\n\nSubtract 200 from both sides:\n\n-10x <= -176\n\nDivide both sides by -10:\n\nx >= 17.6\n\nSince fishermen can't catch a fraction of a ton, the minimum number of tons each fisherman can catch to meet the requirement is 18 tons.\n\nAnswer:Each fisherman can catch a maximum of 18 tons of fish.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.06666666666666667, "score_std": 0.24944382578492946, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.1929003400397002, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2_fishing", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v3.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 958682846, "split": "single"}}
