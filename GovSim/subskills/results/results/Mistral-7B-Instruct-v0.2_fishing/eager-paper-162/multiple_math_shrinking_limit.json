At the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity. This month, there are 83 tons of fish in the lake.\n What is the maximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch without shrinking the lake population, i.e. we still have 83 tons of fish next month?\nLet's think step-by-step. Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: To find the maximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch while keeping the lake population at 83 tons for the next month, we need to consider the amount of fish that will be produced through reproduction.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of tons that will be produced through reproduction:\n\n83 tons (remaining fish) * 2 (reproduction factor) = 166 tons\n\nSince the carrying capacity is 100 tons, the actual number of tons produced through reproduction will be the minimum of the calculated value and the carrying capacity:\n\n166 tons (calculated reproduction) < 100 tons (carrying capacity)\n\nSo, 100 tons will be produced through reproduction.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch while keeping the lake population at 83 tons for the next month. Let's denote the number of tons caught by each fisherman as x, y, z, w, and v.\n\nThe total number of tons caught by all fishermen should not exceed the difference between the initial population (83 tons) and the reproduced population (100 tons):\n\nx + y + z + w + v <= 100 tons - 83 tons = 17 tons\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch is:\n\nAnswer:Each fisherman can catch up to 3.4 tons (rounded down) of fish. Since it's not possible to catch a fraction of a ton, each fisherman can catch up to 3 tons at most.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2_fishing", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v3.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 1181241943, "split": "single"}}
