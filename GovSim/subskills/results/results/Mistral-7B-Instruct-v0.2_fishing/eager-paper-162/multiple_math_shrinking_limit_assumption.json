Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: To find the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch so that after the population doubles, there will be at least 59 tons of fish, we need to determine how many tons of fish can be caught while leaving enough for the lake to reproduce to at least 59 tons.\n\nLet x be the number of tons each fisherman catches. The total amount of fish caught is 5x. After reproduction, the total amount of fish in the lake will be 59 + 5x.\n\nSince the carrying capacity is 100 tons, we have the inequality:\n\n59 + 5x <= 100\n\nSolving for x:\n\n5x <= 41\nx <= 8.2\n\nSince x must be a whole number representing the number of tons each fisherman catches, the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch is 8 tons.\n\nAnswer:Each fisherman can catch a maximum of 8 tons of fish.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2_fishing", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v3.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 1181241943, "split": "single"}}
