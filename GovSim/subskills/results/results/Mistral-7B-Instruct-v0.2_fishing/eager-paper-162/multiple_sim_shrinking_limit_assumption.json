The total number of tons caught by all fishermen is 5x.\n\nAfter reproduction, the number of tons of fish in the lake will be: 100 + 5x.\n\nWe want this number to be greater than or equal to 100 tons, so we have the inequality: 100 + 5x >= 100.\n\nSolving for x, we get: 5x >= 0.

Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: To find the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch while ensuring there will be at least 93 tons of fish after reproduction, we need to determine the minimum number of tons that can double to reach or exceed 93 tons.\n\nLet's call the number of tons each fisherman catches \"x\". The total number of tons caught by all fishermen is 5x.\n\nAfter reproduction, the number of tons of fish in the lake will be: 5x * 2 = 10x\n\nWe want 10x to be greater than or equal to 93 tons. So, we need to find the smallest integer value of x that satisfies this condition:\n\n10x >= 93\nx >= 9.3\n\nSince x must be an integer, the smallest integer value of x that satisfies this condition is 10 (rounding up). This means that each fisherman can catch a maximum of 10 tons of fish per month.\n\nAnswer:Each fisherman can catch a maximum of 10 tons of fish per month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 34}, "answer": 14, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 3, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (Kate, Jack, Emma, Luke).
