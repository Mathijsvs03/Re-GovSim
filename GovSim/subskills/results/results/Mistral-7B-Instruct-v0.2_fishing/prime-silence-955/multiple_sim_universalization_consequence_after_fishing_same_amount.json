Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: First, let's calculate the total amount of fish caught by all fishermen: 5 fishermen * 3 tons = 15 tons.\n\nNext, let's subtract this amount from the current population to find out how many tons of fish will be left after everyone fishes: 21 tons (current population) - 15 tons (total catch) = 6 tons.\n\nNow, let's calculate the population after reproduction. Since the population can't exceed the carrying capacity, we'll set the population equal to the carrying capacity and solve for the initial population of fish that would result in this amount after reproduction: 100 tons (carrying capacity) = 6 tons (population after fishing and reproduction) * 2 (reproduction factor) + initial population.\n\nSolving for the initial population: 100 = 12*initial population => initial population = 100/12 \u2248 8.33 tons. Since the population must be a whole number, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 9 tons.\n\nSo, if each fisherman catches 3 tons, there will be 9 tons of fish left at the end of the month before reproduction, and 100 tons after reproduction.\n\nAnswer:100 tons.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 32, "num_tonnes_fisher": 1}, "answer": 54, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 54, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Emma, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Jack, Luke).
