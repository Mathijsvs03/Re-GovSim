The total number of tons caught by all fishermen is 5X.\n\nAfter reproduction, the population will be 5X * 2 = 10X tons.\n\nTo ensure there are at least 44 tons of fish, we need to find the smallest value of 10X that is greater than or equal to 44:\n\n10X >= 44\n10X = 44 + a (where a > 0)\nX = (44 + a) / 10\n\nWe want to find the smallest possible value of X.

Since a is the result of reproduction, the smaller the initial population, the smaller the reproduction factor will be, and the smaller the value of a.\n\nLet's find the minimum initial population that results in a small enough reproduction factor to make a small enough value of a.\n\nIf we assume that the reproduction factor is a constant value, then the population after reproduction is 10 times the initial population.
