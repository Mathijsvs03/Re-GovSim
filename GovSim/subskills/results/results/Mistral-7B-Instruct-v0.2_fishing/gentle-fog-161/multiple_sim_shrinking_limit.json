Let's calculate the minimum number of tons that the lake should have after reproduction to meet this requirement.\n\nGiven that the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons and there are 5 fishermen, the total amount of fish that can be caught in a month is 100 tons. After reproduction, the lake will have double the amount of fish that were left at the end of the month.\n\nLet x be the number of tons that each fisherman catches in a month. The total number of tons caught by all fishermen is 5x. The remaining number of tons after reproduction is 100 + 5x - 5x = 100.\n\nTo ensure that there are at least 20 tons of fish left after reproduction, we need to have 20 tons as a minimum. Therefore, the minimum number of tons that the lake should have after reproduction is 100 + 5x >= 20 * 2.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n100 + 5x >= 40\n5x >= 30\nx >= 6\n\nSo, each fisherman can catch a maximum of 6 tons of fish per month without shrinking the lake population.\n\nAnswer:Each fisherman can catch a maximum of 6 tons of fish per month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 83}, "answer": 100, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 8, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Emma, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Jack, Luke).

Let's assume that Emma catches x tons, John catches y tons, Kate catches z tons, Jack catches w tons, and Luke catches v tons.\n\nThe total number of tons caught by all fishermen is x + y + z + w + v.\n\nThe number of tons of fish left after reproduction is: 83 + (x + y + z + w + v) * 2\n\nWe want this number to be greater than or equal to 83 tons, so we can set up the following inequality:\n\n83 + (x + y + z + w + v) * 2 >= 83\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx + (y + z + w + v) * 2 >= 0\n\nSince each fisherman's catch is between 0 and 100 tons, the maximum value of x for this inequality to hold is when y = z = w = v = 0.
