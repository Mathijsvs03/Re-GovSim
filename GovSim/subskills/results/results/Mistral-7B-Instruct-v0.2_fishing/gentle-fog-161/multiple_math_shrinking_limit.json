However, since the carrying capacity is 100 tons, the lake can only support an additional 87 tons of fish (100 tons total - 13 tons current).\n4. Therefore, the lake will produce 87 tons of fish during the month.\n\nNow, we need to divide the total amount of fish produced during the month (87 tons) by the number of fishermen (5) to find the maximum amount of fish each fisherman can catch:\n\nAnswer:Each fisherman can catch a maximum of 17.4 tons of fish (87 tons total / 5 fishermen). However, since it's not possible for a fisherman to catch a fraction of a ton, they should aim to catch 18 tons or less to ensure there are at least 13 tons of fish remaining in the lake.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2_fishing", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v3.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 2746317213, "split": "single"}}
