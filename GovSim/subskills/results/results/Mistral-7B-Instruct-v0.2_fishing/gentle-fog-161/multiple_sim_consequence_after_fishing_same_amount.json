For example, if there are 90 tons of fish at the beginning of the month and the five fishermen catch a total of 30 fish, there will be 60 tons of fish left at the end of the month before reproduction, and 100 tons after reproduction.\nLocation: lake\nDate: 2024-01-01\n\nKey memories of John (format: YYYY-MM-DD: memory):\n- 2024-01-01: Before everyone fishes, there are 90 tons of fish in the lake.\n\n\nTask:  If each fisherman catches 0 tons, how many tons of fish will there be next month?\nLet's think step-by-step.
