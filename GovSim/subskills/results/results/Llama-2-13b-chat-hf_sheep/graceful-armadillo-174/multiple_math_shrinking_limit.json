Each month, each shepherd decides how many flocks of sheep to take to the pasture. At the end of the month, the remaining grass doubles once in quantity, but only up to the pasture's maximum capacity of 100 hectares. This month, there are 42 hectares of grass in the pasture.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass, i.e. we still have 42 hectares of grass next month?\n\nLet's think step-by-step:\n\n1. The pasture has 42 hectares of grass this month.\n2. Each shepherd can take up to 100 hectares of grass, since that is the maximum capacity of the pasture.\n3. If a shepherd takes all 100 hectares, there will be no grass left for the other shepherds.\n4. Therefore, each shepherd can take at most 42/100 = 0.42 (or 42%) of the total grass.\n5. Since there are 5 shepherds, each shepherd can take 0.42 x 5 = 2.1 (or 21%) of the total grass.\n\nAnswer:Each shepherd can take up to 21% of the total grass, or 21/100 = 210 flocks of sheep.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 49}, "answer": 1, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 4, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five shepherd share a pasture.
