Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this problem! Here's how we can solve it step by step:\n\n1. First, we know that the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish, and there are currently 79 tons of fish in the lake.\n2. Each fisherman decides how many fish to catch from the lake, and we're told that each fisherman catches 6 tons of fish. So, together, the five fishermen catch 5 x 6 = 30 tons of fish.\n3. After the fishermen catch their fish, the remaining fish in the lake will reproduce and double, up to the carrying capacity of the lake. So, the number of fish in the lake after the fishermen catch their fish will be:\n\n79 tons - 30 tons = 49 tons\n\nSince the lake can hold a maximum of 100 tons of fish, we know that the number of fish in the lake after the fishermen catch their fish will be less than or equal to 100 tons. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer:49 tons\n\nNext month, the fish in the lake will reproduce and double, up to the carrying capacity of the lake, so the number of fish in the lake will be:\n\n49 tons x 2 = 98 tons\n\nTherefore, there will be 98 tons of fish in the lake next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Jack", "num_tonnes_lake": 49, "num_tonnes_fisher": 5}, "answer": 48, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 48, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five fishermen fish in a lake.
