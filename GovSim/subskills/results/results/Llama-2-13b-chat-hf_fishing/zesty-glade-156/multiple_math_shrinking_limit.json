This month, there are 83 tons of fish in the lake.\n What is the maximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch without shrinking the lake population, i.e. we still have 83 tons of fish next month?\nLet's think step-by-step. Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  Sure, I can help you with that! Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. The lake has 83 tons of fish at the beginning of the month.\n2. Each fisherman decides how many fish to catch, and the total amount caught cannot exceed 83 tons.\n3. If a fisherman catches x tons of fish, then the lake will have 83 - x tons of fish remaining.\n4. Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, we know that the remaining fish will reproduce and double to 166 tons (100 - 83 + 83) at the end of the month.\n5. Therefore, the maximum amount each fisherman can catch without shrinking the lake population is:\n\nAnswer:83 / 2 = 41.5 tons\n\nSince each fisherman can only catch whole numbers of tons, the maximum amount each fisherman can catch is 41 tons. If any fisherman catches more than 41 tons, the lake population will shrink, and there will be less fish to reproduce at the end of the month.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.06666666666666667, "score_std": 0.24944382578492943, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.1929003400397002, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_fishing", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v3.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 1181241943, "split": "single"}}
