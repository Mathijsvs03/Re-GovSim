At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish between 0 and 100 tons to catch from the lake, and that amount is then removed from the lake. At the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity. This month, there are 13 tons of fish in the lake.\n What is the maximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch without shrinking the lake population, i.e. we still have 13 tons of fish next month?\nLet's think step-by-step. Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  Sure, I can help you with that! Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. The lake has 13 tons of fish at the beginning of the month.\n2. Each fisherman decides how many fish to catch, and the total amount caught cannot exceed the carrying capacity of the lake (100 tons).\n3. Let's assume that the five fishermen catch a total of x tons of fish.\n4. The amount of fish caught by each fisherman is subtracted from the total amount of fish in the lake, so the remaining fish are:\n\n13 - x tons\n\n5. Since the fish reproduce and double at the end of the month, the remaining fish will become:\n\n13 - x tons x 2 = 26 - 2x tons\n\n6. Since we want to ensure that the lake population does not shrink, we need to make sure that the amount of fish caught by each fisherman does not exceed the amount that can be sustained by the lake. In other words, we need to make sure that:\n\n26 - 2x tons > 100 tons\n\n7. Solving for x, we get:\n\n2x < 16\n\nx < 8\n\n8. Therefore, each fisherman can catch at most 8 tons of fish without shrinking the lake population.\n\nAnswer:Each fisherman can catch at most 8 tons of fish without shrinking the lake population.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_fishing", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v3.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 2746317213, "split": "single"}}
