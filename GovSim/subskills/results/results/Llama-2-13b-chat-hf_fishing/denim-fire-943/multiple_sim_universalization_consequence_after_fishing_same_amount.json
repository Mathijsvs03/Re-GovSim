Let's work through this problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's review the information we have:\n\n* There are 17 tons of fish in the lake at the beginning of the month.\n* Each fisherman can catch between 0 and 100 tons of fish.\n* If a fisherman catches more than 1 ton, the lake population will shrink next month.\n* If a fisherman catches less than 1 ton, the lake population will increase next month.\n* The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish.\n\nNow, let's think about what will happen if each fisherman catches 2 tons of fish.\n\n1. Jack catches 2 tons of fish, so there are 17 - 2 = 15 tons of fish left in the lake.\n2. John catches 2 tons of fish, so there are 15 - 2 = 13 tons of fish left in the lake.\n3. Kate catches 2 tons of fish, so there are 13 - 2 = 11 tons of fish left in the lake.\n4. Emma catches 2 tons of fish, so there are 11 - 2 = 9 tons of fish left in the lake.\n5. Luke catches 2 tons of fish, so there are 9 - 2 = 7 tons of fish left in the lake.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of fish caught by all five fishermen:\n\n5 x 2 = 10 tons\n\nSo, there are 7 - 10 = -3 tons of fish left in the lake after all five fishermen catch 2 tons each.\n\nSince the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, and there are already 17 tons of fish in the lake at the beginning of the month, we know that the lake will not be able to support a negative number of fish. Therefore, we must have:\n\n-3 = 0\n\nThis means that there will be 0 tons of fish left in the lake after all five fishermen catch 2 tons each.\n\nNow, let's think about what will happen next month. Since there are no fish left in the lake, all five fishermen will catch 0 tons of fish next month.\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"If each fisherman catches 2 tons, how many tons of fish will there be next month?\" is:\n\nAnswer:There will be 0 tons of fish next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 96, "num_tonnes_fisher": 18}, "answer": 12, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 12, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Luke, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Jack, Emma).

First, we know that the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish.\n2. At the beginning of the month, there are 96 tons of fish in the lake.\n3. If each fisherman catches 18 tons, we need to calculate how many tons of fish will be left in the lake after everyone has fished.\n4. If each fisherman catches 18 tons, the total amount of fish caught will be:\n\n18 tons x 5 fishermen = 90 tons\n\nSo, the amount of fish left in the lake after everyone has fished will be:\n\n96 tons - 90 tons = 6 tons\n\n5. Since there are still 6 tons of fish left in the lake, the population will not shrink next month. In fact, the population will actually increase next month due to reproduction.\n6. To calculate the amount of fish that will be in the lake next month, we need to double the remaining 6 tons of fish.\n\n6 tons x 2 = 12 tons\n\nSo, there will be 12 tons of fish in the lake next month.\n\nAnswer:There will be 12 tons of fish in the lake next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Kate", "num_tonnes_lake": 33, "num_tonnes_fisher": 2}, "answer": 77, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 46, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Kate, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Jack, Emma, Luke).

Let's work through this problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 79 tons of fish in the lake at the beginning of the month. If each fisherman catches 2 tons, we need to calculate how many tons of fish will be left in the lake after everyone has fished.\n\nLet's assume that the other four fishermen also catch 2 tons each, for a total of 8 tons caught by all five fishermen. This means that 79 - 8 = 71 tons of fish will be left in the lake after everyone has fished.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many tons of fish will be produced next month due to reproduction. Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, we know that the population will double next month if there is enough food available.\n\nSo, if there are 71 tons of fish in the lake at the end of the month, we can expect 71 x 2 = 142 tons of fish to be produced next month.\n\nNow, let's add the amount of fish produced next month to the amount of fish left in the lake at the end of the month:\n\n142 + 71 = 213 tons of fish\n\nTherefore, there will be 213 tons of fish in the lake at the beginning of the next month.\n\nAnswer:There will be 213 tons of fish in the lake at the beginning of the next month.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.3333333333333333, "score_std": 0.47140452079103173, "score_ci_lower": 0.09477411417104564, "score_ci_upper": 0.571892552495621, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_fishing", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v3.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 958682846, "split": "single"}}
