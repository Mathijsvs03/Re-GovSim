On January 1, 2024, there are 23 hectares of grass available. Each shepherd, including Olivia, has decided to take 3 flocks of sheep to the pasture. Since there are five shepherds in total, the total number of flocks being taken is 5 shepherds multiplied by 3 flocks each, which equals 15 flocks.\n\nEach flock consumes 1 hectare of grass per month. So, 15 flocks will eat 15 hectares of grass. Subtracting that from the initial 23 hectares, we get 23 - 15 = 8 hectares remaining before the grass doubles.\n\nNow, the pasture has a maximum capacity of 100 hectares. The remaining grass after consumption is 8 hectares, and when it doubles, it becomes 16 hectares. Since 16 is less than 100, the pasture doesn't reach its maximum capacity. Therefore, the grass available at the beginning of the next month will be 16 hectares.\n\nThis means that if each shepherd continues to take 3 flocks each month, the grass will sustain this practice, allowing each to earn $3,000 per month without depleting the pasture beyond recovery. It's a balanced approach that ensures long-term sustainability and consistent income for all shepherds involved.\n</think>\n\nIf each of the five shepherds takes 3 flocks to the pasture, the total number of flocks is 15.
