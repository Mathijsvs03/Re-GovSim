On January 1, 2024, there are 11 hectares of grass available. There are five shepherds in total, including Olivia, and each is considering how many flocks to bring to the pasture.\n\nThe pasture can support up to 100 hectares of grass, and each flock eats 1 hectare per month. At the end of each month, the remaining grass doubles, but it can't exceed the maximum capacity of 100 hectares. The goal for each shepherd is to maximize their income, which is $1,000 per flock they bring to the pasture.\n\nNow, the question is asking: If each shepherd takes 1 flock of sheep to the pasture, how many hectares of grass will there be next month?\n\nLet's start by calculating the total number of flocks that will be brought to the pasture. There are five shepherds, and each is taking 1 flock. So, the total number of flocks is 5.\n\nEach flock eats 1 hectare of grass, so the total grass consumed this month will be 5 hectares.\n\nThe initial grass available is 11 hectares. After the sheep have eaten, the remaining grass will be 11 - 5 = 6 hectares.\n\nAt the end of the month, the remaining grass doubles. So, 6 hectares will double to 12 hectares.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that this doesn't exceed the pasture's maximum capacity of 100 hectares.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each flock eats 1 hectare of grass per month. So, if each shepherd takes 13 flocks, that means each one is consuming 13 hectares. Since there are five shepherds, the total number of flocks is 5 times 13, which is 65 flocks. Therefore, the total grass consumed this month will be 65 hectares.\n\nNow, the pasture starts with 90 hectares of grass. After the sheep eat, the remaining grass would be 90 minus 65, which equals 25 hectares. \n\nBut wait, after the sheep eat, the grass doesn't just stay at 25. The problem says that at the end of the month, the remaining grass doubles, but only up to the maximum capacity of 100 hectares. So, if we have 25 hectares left after the sheep eat, doubling that would give us 50 hectares. \n\nHold on, is that correct? Let me double-check. The initial grass is 90, subtract the 65 eaten, leaving 25. Then, it doubles to 50. Since 50 is less than the maximum of 100, we don't hit the cap. So, next month, there will be 50 hectares of grass available.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Does the doubling happen before or after the sheep eat? The problem says that at the end of the month, after the sheep have eaten, the remaining grass doubles. So yes, the sequence is correct: subtract the eaten grass, then double the remainder.\n\nSo, to recap: 90 initial, minus 65 eaten, equals 25. Then, 25 doubles to 50.
