Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: Okay, so I need to figure out how many hectares of grass there will be next month if each of the five shepherds takes 14 flocks to the pasture. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each flock eats 1 hectare of grass per month. So, if each shepherd takes 14 flocks, that means each one is consuming 14 hectares. Since there are five shepherds, the total number of flocks is 5 times 14, which is 70 flocks. Therefore, the total grass consumed this month will be 70 hectares.\n\nNow, the pasture starts with 85 hectares of grass. After the sheep eat, the remaining grass would be 85 minus 70, which equals 15 hectares. \n\nBut wait, after the sheep eat, the grass doesn't stay at 15 hectares. The problem states that at the end of the month, the remaining grass doubles, but only up to the maximum capacity of 100 hectares. So, if we have 15 hectares left after the sheep eat, doubling that would give us 30 hectares. \n\nHold on, is that correct? Let me double-check. The initial grass is 85. Subtract the 70 eaten by the sheep, leaving 15. Then, the grass doubles to 30. Since 30 is less than the maximum of 100, it doesn't get capped. So, yes, the grass next month would be 30 hectares.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Does the doubling happen before or after the sheep eat? The problem says the remaining grass doubles after the sheep have eaten. So, the sequence is: start with 85, subtract the 70 eaten, get 15, then double to 30. That makes sense.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 85 - 70 = 15, then 15 * 2 = 30. Therefore, next month there will be 30 hectares of grass.\n</think>\n\nThe pasture starts with 85 hectares. Each of the five shepherds takes 14 flocks, totaling 70 flocks. Each flock eats 1 hectare, so 70 hectares are consumed. This leaves 15 hectares.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each flock eats 1 hectare of grass per month. Since there are five shepherds, each taking 1 flock, that means a total of 5 flocks. So, the total grass consumed this month will be 5 hectares.\n\nThe pasture currently has 39 hectares of grass at the beginning of the month. After the sheep eat, the remaining grass will be 39 - 5 = 34 hectares.\n\nNow, at the end of the month, the remaining grass doubles, but it can't exceed the maximum capacity of 100 hectares. So, 34 hectares doubling would be 68 hectares. Since 68 is less than 100, the pasture will have 68 hectares next month.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If each shepherd takes 1 flock, that's 5 flocks total. 5 flocks eat 5 hectares. Starting with 39, subtract 5 to get 34. Then, double that to 68. Yep, that seems right. So, next month there will be 68 hectares of grass.\n</think>\n\nIf each of the five shepherds takes 1 flock to the pasture, the total number of flocks is 5. Each flock eats 1 hectare, so 5 hectares are consumed. Starting with 39 hectares, subtracting 5 gives 34 hectares remaining. This remaining grass then doubles to 68 hectares, which is below the maximum capacity of 100.

Each flock eats 1 hectare, so the total grass consumed this month will be 70 hectares.\n\nNow, subtracting the consumed grass from the initial 82 hectares, we get 82 minus 70, which leaves us with 12 hectares of grass remaining before the pasture's grass doubles. However, the pasture can only support up to 100 hectares.

The problem says that at the end of the month, the remaining grass doubles, but only up to the maximum capacity of 100 hectares. So, I need to calculate how much grass is left after the sheep eat and then see what happens when it doubles.\n\nSo, after the sheep eat, there are 31 hectares left.
