Let's call the total amount of fish caught \"x\" tons.\n\nAfter fishing, the number of fish left in the lake is 26 - x tons.\n\nSince the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, the number of fish left in the lake after reproduction will be the minimum of 26 - x and 100. This is because the lake will reproduce to reach its carrying capacity if the number of fish left is less than 100.\n\nSince the lake will reproduce to reach its carrying capacity, the number of fish left after reproduction will be 100. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n26 - x + 2(100 - 26) = 100\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n26 - x + 172 = 100\n\nSubtracting 26 from both sides, we get:\n\nx = 36\n\nSo, the maximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch without shrinking the lake population is 36 tons.\n\nAnswer: 36</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 68}, "answer": 13, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 6, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Emma, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Jack, Luke).
