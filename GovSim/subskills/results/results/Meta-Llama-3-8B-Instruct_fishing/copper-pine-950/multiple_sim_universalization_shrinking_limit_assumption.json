Since each fisherman catches the same amount of fish, let's call the amount x. The total amount of fish caught by all five fishermen is 5x.\n4. The number of tons present in the lake before reproduction is the initial amount (86 tons) minus the total amount caught (5x). So, the equation is: 86 - 5x \u2265 43\n5.
