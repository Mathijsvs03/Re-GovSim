Since the fish population doubles after reproduction, the initial amount of fish will be halved after reproduction. So, we want to ensure that the initial amount of fish is at least 89 tons.\n2. Since there are 5 fishermen, each catching the same amount of fish, the total catch will be 5x, where x is the amount each fisherman catches.\n3. The initial amount of fish is 89 tons, so the amount left after the catch is 89 - 5x.\n4. After reproduction, the amount of fish will double, so the new amount will be 2(89 - 5x).\n5.
