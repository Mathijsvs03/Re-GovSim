Since each fisherman can catch any amount between 0 and 100 tons, we need to find the maximum amount each fisherman can catch without shrinking the lake population.\n3. To do this, we need to find the maximum amount that, when subtracted from 106 tons, still leaves 53 tons or more. This is because we want to ensure that the lake population doesn't shrink.\n4. Let's try subtracting different amounts from 106 tons to see what works:\n\t* If each fisherman catches 1 ton, the lake would have 105 tons left, which is still above 53 tons.\n\t* If each fisherman catches 2 tons, the lake would have 104 tons left, which is still above 53 tons.\n\t* If each fisherman catches 3 tons, the lake would have 103 tons left, which is still above 53 tons.\n\t*...\n\t* If each fisherman catches 53 tons, the lake would have 0 tons left, which is exactly at the minimum required.\n5. However, we can't have each fisherman catch 53 tons, as that would leave no fish in the lake. We need to find a smaller amount that still leaves 53 tons or more.\n6.
