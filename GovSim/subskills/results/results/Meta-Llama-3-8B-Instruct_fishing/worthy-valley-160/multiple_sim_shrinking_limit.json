The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, so the maximum number of tons that can be caught is 100 - 40 = 60 tons.\n3. Since the fish will reproduce and double at the end of the month, we need to consider the number of tons that will be left after reproduction. Let's assume the fishermen catch x tons of fish. After reproduction, the number of tons will be 40 + (40 - x) = 80 - x.\n4. Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, the maximum number of tons that can be left after reproduction is 100. Therefore, we can set up the inequality: 80 - x \u2264 100.\n5.

The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish. At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish between 0 and 100 tons to catch from the lake, and that amount is then removed from the lake. At the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity. For every ton of fish caught, a fisherman earns one thousand dollars.
