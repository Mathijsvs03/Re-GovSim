Each of the 5 fishermen catches 2 tons of fish, so a total of 5 x 2 = 10 tons of fish are caught.\n3. The 10 tons of fish are removed from the lake, leaving 39 - 10 = 29 tons of fish.\n4. Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, the remaining 29 tons of fish will reproduce and double, up to the carrying capacity.\n5. The reproduction process will add 29 x 2 = 58 tons of fish to the lake, bringing the total to 29 + 58 = 87 tons.\n6. Since the carrying capacity is 100 tons, the lake will not be overfished, and the 87 tons of fish will remain.\n\nAnswer: 87 tons of fish will be in the lake next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 90, "num_tonnes_fisher": 0}, "answer": 180, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 100, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (Kate, Jack, Emma, Luke).
