Since I don't know what the other fishermen will catch this month, I'll start by considering the worst-case scenario, where I'm the only one catching fish. If I catch 0 tons of fish, the lake will still have 100 tons of fish at the end of the month, and then reproduce to 200 tons. If I catch 1 ton of fish, the lake will have 99 tons left, and then reproduce to 198 tons. If I catch 2 tons of fish, the lake will have 98 tons left, and then reproduce to 196 tons, and so on.\n\nI can see that if I catch more than 50 tons of fish, the lake will not be able to reproduce to its full capacity of 100 tons. So, I'll aim to catch less than 50 tons of fish to ensure the lake reproduces to its full capacity.\n\nNow, let's consider the best-case scenario, where I'm not the only one catching fish. If I catch 0 tons of fish, I'll miss out on the opportunity to earn money. If I catch 1 ton of fish, I'll earn $1,000, but the other fishermen might catch more, reducing the lake's fish population and my future earnings. If I catch 2 tons of fish, I'll earn $2,000, but the other fishermen might catch even more, reducing the lake's fish population and my future earnings.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, I think it's best to catch a moderate amount of fish, around 20-30 tons.

I also know that the carrying capacity is 100 tons, and that the fish will reproduce and double once at the end of the month.\n\nMy goal is to optimize my income in the long run, so I want to think about how my decision this month will affect the number of fish available in the future.\n\nIf I catch a large amount of fish this month, it will reduce the number of fish available for the other fishermen to catch next month. On the other hand, if I catch a small amount of fish, it will leave more fish for the other fishermen to catch next month.\n\nSince I don't know what the other fishermen will do this month, I'll make an educated guess. Let's assume that the other fishermen will catch a moderate amount of fish, around 10-20 tons. This will leave around 25-35 tons of fish in the lake at the end of the month.\n\nIf I catch a large amount of fish, say 30 tons, it will reduce the number of fish available for the other fishermen next month. However, it will also increase my income this month, since I'll earn $30,000. On the other hand, if I catch a small amount of fish, say 10 tons, it will leave more fish for the other fishermen next month, but my income will be lower, at $10,000.\n\nConsidering the trade-off, I think it's better to catch a moderate amount of fish, around 20-25 tons. This will give me a decent income this month, while also leaving enough fish for the other fishermen next month. It's a balanced approach that should help me optimize my income in the long run.\n\nAnswer: 22 tons</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 85}, "answer": 25, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 8, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (Kate, Jack, Emma, Luke).

This is because they will want to leave enough fish in the lake for future months, but also want to maximize their income this month.\n\nBased on this assumption, I think it's likely that the other fishermen will catch around 20-30 tons of fish this month. This will leave around 55-65 tons of fish in the lake at the end of the month, before reproduction.\n\nIf I catch a large number of fish this month, I'll be reducing the number of fish available for me to catch in future months.

The remaining fish in the lake will be 15 - x tons.

However, I don't want to catch the maximum amount, as that would leave too few fish for the other fishermen. Let's aim for a more moderate catch.\n\nA good target could be to catch 5-7 tons of fish, which would leave around 8-10 tons for the other fishermen.
