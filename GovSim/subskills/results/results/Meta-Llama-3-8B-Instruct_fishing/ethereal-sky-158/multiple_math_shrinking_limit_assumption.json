At the beginning of the month, there are 81 tons of fish in the lake.\n3. The fish will reproduce and double, up to the carrying capacity of 100 tons.\n4. To find the maximum amount each fisherman can catch, we need to find the maximum amount that will leave at least 81 tons of fish after doubling.\n\nLet's call the amount each fisherman catches \"x\". Since there are 5 fishermen, the total amount caught is 5x.\n\n5. After the fish are caught, the remaining amount of fish is 81 - 5x.\n6. The fish will then double, so the new amount of fish will be 2(81 - 5x).\n7. We want this new amount to be at least 81 tons, so we set up the inequality:\n\n2(81 - 5x) \u2265 81\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get:\n\n162 - 10x \u2265 81\n\nSubtracting 162 from both sides, we get:\n\n-10x \u2265 -81\n\nDividing both sides by -10, we get:\n\nx \u2264 8.1\n\nSince x is the amount each fisherman catches, it must be an integer.
