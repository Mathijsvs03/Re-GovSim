We'll use the given clues to fill in the information step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Alice:**\n   - From clue 1, Alice's favorite number is 3, and her favorite color is blue.\n   - From clue 11, the person who loves the color blue has a favorite fruit that starts with the same letter as their favorite color. Therefore, Alice's favorite fruit is blueberry.\n\n2. **Bob:**\n   - From clue 2, Bob's favorite number is 5, and his favorite fruit is banana.\n\n3. **Charlie:**\n   - From clue 3, Charlie's favorite color is red, and his favorite fruit is cherry.\n\n4. **Diana:**\n   - From clue 4, Diana's favorite number is 1, and her favorite color is green.\n\n5. **Edward:**\n   - From clue 5, Edward's favorite fruit is elderberry, and his favorite number is 6.\n\n6. **Fiona:**\n   - From clue 6, Fiona's favorite color is yellow, and her favorite fruit is fig.\n\nNow, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:\n\n7. **Clue 7:** The person whose favorite number is 2 loves the color purple.\n   - The numbers 1, 3, 5, and 6 are already taken by Diana, Alice, Bob, and Edward, respectively. Therefore, the person with the favorite number 2 must be either Charlie or Fiona.\n   - Since Fiona's favorite color is yellow (clue 6), Charlie must have the favorite number 2 and the favorite color purple.\n\n8. **Clue 8:** The person who loves apples has a favorite number that is one less than the person who loves bananas.\n   - Bob loves bananas and his favorite number is 5. Therefore, the person who loves apples must have the favorite number 4.\n   - The only person left without a number is Fiona, so Fiona's favorite number is 4, and her favorite fruit is apples.\n\n9. **Clue 9:** The person who loves grapes has a favorite number that is one more than the person who loves cherries.\n   - Charlie loves cherries and his favorite number is 2.

The person whose favorite color is orange has a pet that is not a cat.\n\nDetermine each person's favorite number, color, and pet.\n\n## Solution\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to determine each person's favorite number, color, and pet using the given clues. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Favorite Numbers\n\n1. **Charlie's favorite number is the smallest.**  \n   - Therefore, Charlie's favorite number is 1.\n\n2. **Diana's favorite number is the largest.**  \n   - Therefore, Diana's favorite number is 6.\n\n3. **Alice's favorite number is twice that of Bob's.**  \n   - Possible pairs for Alice and Bob are (2, 1), (4, 2), and (6, 3). Since Charlie has 1 and Diana has 6, the only possibility is Alice = 4 and Bob = 2.\n\n4. **Edward's favorite number is one more than Fiona's.**  \n   - The remaining numbers are 3 and 5. Therefore, Edward = 5 and Fiona = 4.\n\nNow we have:\n- Charlie = 1\n- Bob = 2\n- Alice = 4\n- Edward = 5\n- Fiona = 3\n- Diana = 6\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Pets\n\n5. **The person with the cat has a favorite number that is a prime number.**  \n   - Prime numbers between 1 and 6 are 2, 3, and 5. So, Bob, Fiona, or Edward could have the cat.\n\n6. **The person with the dog has a favorite number that is even.**  \n   - Even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. So, Bob, Alice, or Diana could have the dog.\n\n7. **The person with the parrot has a favorite number that is odd.**  \n   - Odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5. So, Charlie, Fiona, or Edward could have the parrot.\n\n8. **The person with the rabbit has a favorite number that is greater than 4.**  \n   - Numbers greater than 4 are 5 and 6. So, Edward or Diana could have the rabbit.\n\n9. **The person with the fish has a favorite number that is less than 3.**  \n   - Numbers less than 3 are 1 and 2. So, Charlie or Bob could have the fish.\n\n10. **The person with the hamster has a favorite number that is neither the smallest nor the largest.**  \n    - Numbers that are neither the smallest (1) nor the largest (6) are 2, 3, 4, and 5.

We'll go through the clues step by step and fill in the information systematically.\n\n### Initial Information from Clues:\n\n1. **Alice**: Number = 3, Color = Blue\n2. **Bob**: Number = 5, Fruit = Banana\n3. **Charlie**: Color = Red, Fruit = Cherry\n4. **Diana**: Number = 1, Color = Green\n5. **Edward**: Number = 6, Fruit = Elderberry\n6. **Fiona**: Color = Yellow, Fruit = Fig\n\n### Analyzing the Clues:\n\n- **Clue 7**: The person whose favorite number is 2 has a favorite color of purple.\n- **Clue 8**: The person whose favorite fruit is apple has a favorite number that is even.\n- **Clue 9**: The person whose favorite color is orange has a favorite number that is odd.\n- **Clue 10**: The person whose favorite fruit is date has a favorite number that is less than 4.\n- **Clue 11**: The person whose favorite color is blue has a favorite fruit that starts with 'B'. (Alice's fruit is Banana)\n- **Clue 12**: The person whose favorite number is 4 has a favorite color that is not red or yellow.\n- **Clue 13**: The person whose favorite fruit is cherry has a favorite number that is greater than 3. (Charlie's number is greater than 3, so it must be 5 or 6. Since Bob has 5, Charlie must have 6, but Edward has 6, so Charlie must have 4.)\n- **Clue 14**: The person whose favorite color is green has a favorite fruit that starts with 'D'. (Diana's fruit is Date)\n- **Clue 15**: The person whose favorite number is 6 has a favorite color that is not purple or orange. (Edward's color is not purple or orange)\n- **Clue 16**: The person whose favorite fruit is fig has a favorite number that is not 2. (Fiona's number is not 2)\n- **Clue 17**: The person whose favorite color is yellow has a favorite number that is not 1. (Fiona's number is not 1)\n- **Clue 18**: The person whose favorite fruit is elderberry has a favorite color that is not blue or green.
