They can use this as an opportunity to negotiate and persuade others to influence their behavior in the next month. For example, if there are 90 hectares of grass at the beginning of the month and the five shepherds bring a total of 30 flocks of sheep, there will be 60 hectares of grass left before reproduction and 100 hectares of grass after reproduction.\nLocation: pasture\nDate: 2024-01-01\n\nKey memories of Olivia (format: YYYY-MM-DD: memory):\n- 2024-01-01: Before the shepherds take their flocks of sheep to the pasture, there are 87 hectares of grass available.\n- 2024-01-01: Given the current situation, if each shepherd take more than 8 flocks of sheep to the pasture, consuming 8 hectares of grass, the available grass in the pasture will decrease next month.\n\n\nTask: Given that each flock of sheep consumes 1 hectare of grass, and considering the available grass range of 0-87 hectares, how many flocks of sheep would you choose to take to the pasture?\nLet's think step-by-step.
