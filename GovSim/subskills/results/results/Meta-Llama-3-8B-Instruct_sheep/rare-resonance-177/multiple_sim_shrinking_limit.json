Since there are 5 shepherds, the total number of flocks of sheep taken to the pasture is 5x.\n\n4. The total amount of grass consumed by the sheep is 5x hectares.\n5. Since the grass is consumed, the remaining grass is 21 - 5x hectares.\n6. The remaining grass doubles at the end of the month, but only up to the pasture's maximum capacity of 100 hectares. This means that the remaining grass will be the minimum of 21 - 5x and 100 hectares.\n7. Since the remaining grass cannot be negative, we set 21 - 5x \u2265 0.
