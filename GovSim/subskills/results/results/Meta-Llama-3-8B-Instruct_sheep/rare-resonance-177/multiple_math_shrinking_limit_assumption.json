The total number of flocks of sheep that can be taken to the pasture is 5x.\n6. The total amount of grass eaten by these flocks of sheep is 5x hectares.\n7. Since the total amount of grass eaten cannot exceed 41 hectares, we can set up the inequality: 5x \u2264 41.\n8. Solving for x, we get: x \u2264 8.2 (since x must be an integer, the maximum value of x is 8).\n\nAnswer: The maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass is 8.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct_sheep", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 1181241943, "split": "single"}}
