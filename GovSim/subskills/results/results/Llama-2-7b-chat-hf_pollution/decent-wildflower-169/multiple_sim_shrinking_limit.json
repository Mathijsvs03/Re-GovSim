At the beginning of the month, the river is 38% unpolluted.\n2. For every pallet of widgets manufactured, the unpolluted water decreases by 1% of the total river volume. So, if the factory owners produce x pallets of widgets, the river will be 38% unpolluted - (1% x total river volume) = 38% - 0.01 x total river volume unpolluted.\n3. After the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be 38% unpolluted + (1% x total river volume) = 38% + 0.01 x total river volume unpolluted.\n4.

For every pallet of widgets manufactured, the river's unpolluted water decreases by 1% of the total river volume. So, if the factory owners produce x pallets of widgets, the river's unpolluted water will decrease by 1% of the total river volume, which is equal to 0.01x.\n\nAt the end of the month, the river's unpolluted water will double, so the new unpolluted water percentage will be 1.2x.\n\nThe goal of each factory owner is to maximize their income, which is equal to the number of pallets of widgets produced multiplied by $1000 per pallet.\n\nSo, the optimization problem can be formulated as:\n\nMaximize the total income of the factory owners\nSubject to the constraint: After the river's unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 72% unpolluted\n\nLet's solve this problem using linear programming.

The goal of each factory owner is to optimize their income over the long run, while also considering the impact of their production on the river's pollution level.\n\nTo find the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, we need to find the point at which the river's unpolluted water level reaches 38% after the recovery.\n\nLet's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. At the beginning of the month, the river is 38% unpolluted.\n2. For every pallet of widgets manufactured, the unpolluted water decreases by 1% of the total river volume. So, if the factory owners produce x pallets of widgets, the river will be 38% unpolluted - (1% x total river volume) = 38% - 0.01 x total river volume unpolluted.\n3. After the recovery, the river's unpolluted water level will double, which means it will become 38% x 2 = 76% unpolluted.\n4. To find the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, we need to find the point at which the river's unpolluted water level reaches 38%. So, we set the above equation to 38% and solve for x: 76% = 38% - (1% x total river volume).\n5. Solving for x, we get: x = 40 pallets of widgets.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is 40 pallets.

So, if the total river volume is X, then the percentage of unpolluted water after manufacturing 1 pallet of widgets is X - 1%.\n\nNow, let's assume that each factory owner produces x pallets of widgets in a month. The total number of pallets produced by all five factory owners is 5x.\n\nAfter the unpolluted water doubles, the percentage of unpolluted water in the river will increase by 100% of the initial percentage.
