Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  Great, let's solve this problem step-by-step!\n\nWe know that the river starts at 0% unpolluted and doubles its percentage of unpolluted water at the end of each month. So, after one month, the river will be 2% unpolluted (since it doubles to 2 x 0.61 = 1.22 unpolluted).\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the river doubles its percentage of unpolluted water again, the river will be at least 61% unpolluted.\n\nLet's assume that the maximum number of widgets produced by each factory owner is x. Then, the total number of widgets produced by all five factory owners is 5x.\n\nAt the end of the month, the river will be 1.22% unpolluted, so the total amount of pollution generated by all five factory owners is 1.22% x 5 = 0.61% of the total number of widgets produced.\n\nSince we want the river to be at least 61% unpolluted after it doubles its percentage of unpolluted water again, we can set up the following equation:\n\n0.61% = 0.61 x (1 + (x/5))\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 100\n\nAnswer:The maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is 100.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.06666666666666667, "score_std": 0.24944382578492946, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.1929003400397002, "config": {"code_version": "v7.1", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_pollution", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 958682846, "split": "single"}}
