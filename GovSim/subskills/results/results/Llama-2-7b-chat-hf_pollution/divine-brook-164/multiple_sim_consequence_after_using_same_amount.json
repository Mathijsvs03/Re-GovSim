We need to calculate the percentage of pollution in the river after this production.\n\nFrom the information given, we know that the total river volume is 100%. If 1 widget is produced, the percentage of pollution in the river will be:\n\nPollution percentage = (1 widget / 100%) x (100% - 42%) = 58%\n\nSo, the river will be 58% polluted next month if each factory owner produces 1 widget.\n\nAnswer:58%</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 39, "num_tonnes_fisher": 2}, "answer": 38, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 58, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Luke, a factory owner.

This means that the total volume of the river was 100 - 96 = 4% polluted before production began.\n\nNow, let's assume that each factory owner produces 13 widgets. Since each pallet of widgets generates 1% pollution, the total pollution generated by the factory owners will be 13 x 1% = 0.13% of the total river volume.\n\nSo, after the factory owners produce their widgets, the river will be 4% + 0.13% = 4.13% polluted.\n\nAnswer:The river will be 4.13% polluted next month.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.1", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_pollution", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 2746317213, "split": "single"}}
