Each factory owner produces 2 widgets, resulting in a total of 10 pallets of widgets produced (2 widgets x 5 factory owners = 10 pallets).\n3. Since each pallet of widgets generates 1 unit of pollution, the total pollution generated this month is 10 units (10 pallets x 1 unit of pollution per pallet = 10 units).\n4. Since the river recovers by 75% at the end of the month, the percentage of unpolluted water in the river increases to 75% (50% original + 75% recovery = 125%).\n5. To find out how much the river will be polluted next month, we need to calculate the percentage increase in pollution based on the total pollution generated this month. Since the river is 75% unpolluted now, the percentage increase in pollution can be calculated as follows:\n\nPercentage increase in pollution = (Total pollution generated - 75% of total pollution generated) / 75% of total pollution generated\n= (10 - 75% of 10) / 75% of 10\n= (3 - 5.75) / 75% of 10\n= -2.75 / 75% of 10\n= 3.5\n\nSo, the river will be 3.5 units more polluted next month.\n\nAnswer:3.5 units more polluted next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 86, "num_tonnes_fisher": 5}, "answer": 1, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 100, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river.

The amount of pollution generated depends on the number of widgets produced by each factory owner. Since there are 5 factory owners, the total pollution generated is 5 x 3 = 15 pollution units.\n3. Since the river recovers at the end of the month, the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. So, after the pollution is generated, the river becomes 31% unpolluted again.\n4.
