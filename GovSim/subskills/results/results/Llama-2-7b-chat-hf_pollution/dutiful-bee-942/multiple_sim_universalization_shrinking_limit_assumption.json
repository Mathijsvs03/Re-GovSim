If each factory owner produces the same amount of widgets, then the total number of widgets produced by all five factory owners is equal to the total number of pallets of widgets they produce.\n\nLet's call the total number of widgets produced by all five factory owners as \"x\". Since each factory owner produces the same amount of widgets, we can write:\n\nx = 5x\n\nwhere \"5\" is the number of factory owners.\n\nNow, let's analyze the impact of widget production on the river's unpolluted water. As we know, for every 1 pallet of widgets manufactured, the unpolluted water in the river decreases by 1% of the total river volume. Since the river is initially 32% unpolluted, we can calculate the total river volume as follows:\n\nRiver volume = 32% of 100 = 3.2 million gallons\n\nSo, for every 1 pallet of widgets produced, the unpolluted water in the river decreases by 3.2 million gallons.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce while keeping the river's unpolluted water above 32%. We can do this by solving the following equation:\n\nx + 5x = 3.2 million gallons\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n6x = 3.2 million gallons\n\nDividing both sides by 6, we get:\n\nx = 0.533 million gallons\n\nSo, the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce while keeping the river's unpolluted water above 32% is:\n\nx = 0.533 million gallons / 5 = 106,600 widgets\n\nAnswer:The maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is 106,600 widgets.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 79}, "answer": 39, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 7, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a factory owner.

Since the river is initially 79% unpolluted, if all factory owners produce the same amount of widgets, the total number of pallets of widgets produced will result in a decrease of 79% of the river's unpolluted water.\n\nNow, let's think about how the river's unpolluted water percentage will change after the unpolluted water doubles. If the river's unpolluted water percentage decreases by 1% of the total river volume for every 1 pallet of widgets manufactured, and the unpolluted water doubles after the month, then the river's unpolluted water percentage will increase by 1% of the total river volume for every 1 pallet of widgets produced.\n\nSo, if the river is initially 79% unpolluted and the unpolluted water doubles after the month, the river will be 158% unpolluted (79% + 79% = 158%).\n\nNow, let's find the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce while keeping the river at least 79% unpolluted after the unpolluted water doubles.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that the river will be at least 79% unpolluted after the unpolluted water doubles.

The goal of each factory owner is to maximize their income over the long run, while also minimizing the pollution in the river.\n\nWe can start by using the information that the river will double its unpolluted water percentage at the end of the month.

As we know, for every 1 pallet of widgets manufactured, the unpolluted water in the river decreases by 1% of the total river volume. Since the river is initially 63% unpolluted, we can calculate the total river volume as follows:\n\nRiver volume = 63% of the total river volume\n\nNow, let's see how the river's unpolluted water changes after each factory owner produces widgets. If each factory owner produces \"x\" widgets, the total number of widgets produced by all five factory owners becomes:\n\nx + x + x + x + x = 5x\n\nNow, let's calculate the new percentage of unpolluted water in the river after each factory owner produces widgets:\n\nNew river volume = (63% of the total river volume) - (1% of the total river volume x number of widgets produced)\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 63% unpolluted. To do this, we will set up an equation based on the given information:\n\nNew river volume = (63% of the total river volume) - (1% of the total river volume x number of widgets produced) = 63% - (1% x x)\n\nNow, we want to maximize the number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, subject to the constraint that the river's unpolluted water must be at least 63% after the unpolluted water doubles. We can write this constraint as:\n\nNew river volume >= 63%\n\nNow, we can solve the optimization problem using linear programming techniques.

After the unpolluted water doubles, the river's unpolluted water will be 120% (63% + 57%), which is greater than or equal to 63%.

The objective function is to maximize the number of widgets produced, subject to the constraint that the unpolluted water in the river will be at least 61% after the recovery. The constraints are:\n\n1. The total number of pallets produced by all factory owners is equal to 100.\n2. The unpolluted water in the river decreases by 1% of the total river volume for every pallet produced.\n\nUsing a linear programming solver, we can find the optimal solution, which is:\n\nx1 = 20\nx2 = 20\nx3 = 15\nx4 = 15\nx5 = 10\n\nAnswer:The maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is 20 pallets.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.06666666666666667, "score_std": 0.24944382578492943, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.1929003400397002, "config": {"code_version": "v7.1", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_pollution", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 958682846, "split": "single"}}
