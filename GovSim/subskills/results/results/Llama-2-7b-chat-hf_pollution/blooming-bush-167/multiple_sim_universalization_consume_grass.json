The goal of each factory owner is to optimize their income over the long run.\n\nBased on these factors, we need to find the production level that maximizes the income of each factory owner while keeping the river's unpolluted water level as high as possible.\n\nLet's assume the production level for each factory owner is x pallets. The total production level for all five factory owners is then 5x pallets.\n\nThe income for each factory owner is $1,000 per pallet of widgets produced. Therefore, the total income for all five factory owners is $5,000 per pallet x 5x pallets = $25,000.\n\nNow, let's consider the impact of production on the river's unpolluted water level. If each factory owner produces x pallets, the total reduction in unpolluted water is 1% x 5x pallets = 0.05% of the river's total volume.\n\nSince the river starts the month with 42% unpolluted water, the total volume of the river is 42% x 100% = 42,000 cubic meters.\n\nTherefore, the reduction in unpolluted water due to production is 0.05% x 42,000 cubic meters = 210 cubic meters.\n\nNow, let's calculate the impact of this reduction on the river's unpolluted water level after one month:\n\n1% of the river's total volume is restored after one month, which is 42% x 100% = 42,000 cubic meters.\n\nTherefore, the new unpolluted water level in the river after one month is 42,000 cubic meters - 210 cubic meters = 41,790 cubic meters.\n\nAnswer:I would produce 20 pallets of widgets.\n\nExplanation: By producing 20 pallets, I maximize my income while keeping the reduction in unpolluted water to a minimum. If I produce more than 20 pallets, the reduction in unpolluted water will be higher, and the river's unpolluted water level will decrease more significantly after one month.
