At the end of each month, the number of widgets produced by each owner will be revealed, and the owners will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this period of communication as an opportunity to negotiate with or persuade others to produce less pollution in the next month. For example, if the river is 90% unpolluted at the beginning of the month and the five factory owners create a total of 30 pallets of widgets, the river will be 60% unpolluted before recovery and 100% unpolluted after recovery.\nLocation: river\nDate: 2024-01-01\n\nKey memories of Kate (format: YYYY-MM-DD: memory):\n- 2024-01-01: Before the factory owners start production for the month, the river is 12% unpolluted.\n- 2024-01-01: Given the current situation, if each factory owner produces more than 1 widgets, consuming 1% of unpolluted water, the unpolluted water in the river will decrease next month.\n\n\nTask:  If each factory owner produces 2 widgets, how much will the river be polluted next month?\nLet's think step-by-step. Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: First, let's calculate the total number of pallets produced by all five factory owners if each produces 2 pallets: 5 factory owners * 2 pallets = 10 pallets.\n\nSince 1 pallet of widgets consumes 1% of the unpolluted water, the total percentage of unpolluted water that will be consumed is 10 pallets * 1% = 0.1 or 10%.\n\nSo, after the production, the percentage of unpolluted water in the river will be 12% - 10% = 2%.\n\nBefore recovery, the percentage of unpolluted water will be 2%, and after recovery, it will double, making it 4%.\n\nAnswer:The river will be 4% unpolluted next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Kate", "num_tonnes_lake": 79, "num_tonnes_fisher": 2}, "answer": 89, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 100, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Kate, a factory owner. Every month, you decide how many widgets to make with four other factory owners (John, Jack, Emma, Luke) that are situated on the banks of a river. For every 1 pallet of widgets manufactured, unpolluted water decreased by 1% of the total river volume. At the beginning of each month, each factory owner chooses to manufacture between 0 and 100 pallets of widgets, and corresponding pollution is generated. At the end of the month, the river recovers, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. For every pallet of widgets, the factory owner earns one thousand dollars. Each factory owner's goal is to optimize his income over the long run. At the end of each month, the number of widgets produced by each owner will be revealed, and the owners will have the opportunity to communicate with each other.
