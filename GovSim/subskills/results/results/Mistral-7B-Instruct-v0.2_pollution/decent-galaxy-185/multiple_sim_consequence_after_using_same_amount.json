If each factory owner produces 2 pallets of widgets, then the total number of pallets produced is 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 pallets.\n\nSince 1 pallet of widgets decreases the unpolluted water by 1%, the total decrease in unpolluted water is 10 pallets * 1% = <<10*0.01=0.1>>0.1 or 10%.\n\nAfter the recovery, the percentage of unpolluted water doubles, so it becomes 97% * 2 = <<97*2=194>>194%. However, since the percentage cannot be more than 100%, we need to subtract the excess and keep only the first 100%.
