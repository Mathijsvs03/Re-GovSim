Since the percentage of unpolluted water doubles at the end of each month, we can calculate the total pollution by finding the percentage of polluted water.\n\n1. The river is currently 78% polluted (100% - 22%).\n2. We don't have information about the number of pallets produced by each factory owner this month.\n3. To find the pollution next month, we need to calculate the total pollution generated by all five factory owners this month.\n4. Without this information, we cannot determine the pollution level in the river next month.\n\nAnswer:</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 64, "num_tonnes_fisher": 12}, "answer": 0, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 8, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river. At the beginning of each month, each factory owner chooses to manufacture between 0 and 100 pallets of widgets, and corresponding pollution is generated. At the end of the month, the river recovers, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. This month, the river is 64% unpolluted.\n If each factory owner produces 12 widgets, how much will the river be polluted next month?\nLet's think step-by-step. Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: To find out how much the river will be polluted next month, we first need to determine the current total pollution level and then calculate the pollution generated by each factory owner for next month.\n\n1. Let's assume there are a total of X pallets produced by all five factory owners this month.\n2. Since the river is 64% unpolluted, it means that 36% of the river is polluted.\n3. Each pallet produces some amount of pollution. Since each factory owner produces 12 widgets per pallet, and each widget produces some pollution, we can represent the total pollution from one pallet as P.\n4. So, the total pollution from all X pallets is X * P.\n5. The river recovers at the end of the month, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. This means that the percentage of polluted water is now half of what it was before.\n6. Since the river was 36% polluted before, it will now be 72% polluted (36% * 2).\n7. To find the total pollution generated by all five factory owners next month, we need to know how many pallets they will produce in total. Let Y be the number of pallets produced by all five factory owners next month.\n8. Since the river is now 72% polluted, the amount of unpolluted water is 28%. This means that the total pollution from next month's production should be equal to or greater than the current pollution level (X * P) to make the river 72% polluted.\n9. We don't have enough information to determine the exact number of pallets produced by each factory owner next month. However, we can calculate the minimum number of pallets they need to produce to reach a 72% pollution level.\n10. Let's assume that the pollution from one pallet is P. Then, the total pollution from all X pallets is X * P. To reach a 72% pollution level, the total pollution from next month's production should be 1.5 * (X * P).\n11. Let's denote the number of pallets produced by each factory owner next month as x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5. Then, 1.5 * (X * P) = x1 * P + x2 * P + x3 * P + x4 * P + x5 * P.\n12. To minimize the number of pallets produced by each factory owner next month, we need to find the smallest integer values for x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5 that satisfy the equation above.\n13. Unfortunately, without knowing the value of X or P, it's impossible to determine the exact number of pallets that will pollute the river next month.\n\nAnswer:</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.1", "debug": false, "group_name": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2_pollution", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 2746317213, "split": "single"}}
