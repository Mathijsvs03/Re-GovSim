The percentage of unpolluted water after recovery is given by the formula:\n\nUnpolluted water percentage = Initial unpolluted water percentage * (1 - Total pollution percentage) * 2\n\nWe want the unpolluted water percentage to be at least 83%.

Since the river is a shared resource, we can assume that the total river volume is the sum of the volumes of each factory owner's section of the river. Let's assume that each factory owner's section of the river has a volume of V.
