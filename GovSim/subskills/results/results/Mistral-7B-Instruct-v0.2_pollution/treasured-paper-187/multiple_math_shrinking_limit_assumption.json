Since the river is initially 16% unpolluted, we'll represent the total pollution generated as p.\n\nWe know that the pollution generated by producing one pallet of widgets is not given, so we cannot directly calculate the maximum number of widgets based on the initial pollution percentage.

Since the river is initially 51% unpolluted, we'll calculate the maximum pollution that can be generated and still maintain a 51% unpolluted river after the water doubles.\n\n1. First, let's find the total pollution generated by all factories when producing x pallets of widgets each.\nTotal pollution = 5 factory owners * x pallets\n\n2.

Since each factory owner produces the same amount, x is the same for all of them.\n\nThe total pollution generated is 5x (since there are five factory owners). The river starts at 82% unpolluted, and after it recovers, it becomes 164% unpolluted (since the percentage of unpolluted water doubles).\n\nLet P be the total pollution in the river at the end of the month. We have:\n\n82% * (100 - P) = 164% * P\n\nTo solve for P, we can first find the value of 100 - P:\n\n82% * (100 - P) = 164% * P\n82 * (100 - P) = 164 * P\n100 - P = (164/82) * P\n100 - P = 2 * P\n101 = 3 * P\nP = 101 / 3 \u2248 33.67\n\nSince pollution cannot be negative or greater than 100, we need to find the closest integer value of x that results in a total pollution less than or equal to 100.\n\nLet's test some values of x:\n\n- If x = 0, then the total pollution is 0, and the river is 100% unpolluted, which is more than the required 82%.\n- If we increase x, the pollution also increases. Let's find the smallest value of x that results in a total pollution greater than 100.\n\nWe know that the pollution generated by one pallet is less than 100 (since the maximum number of pallets is 100). Therefore, the smallest value of x that results in a total pollution greater than 100 is x = 101 / 3 \u2248 33.67 (which we calculated earlier). However, since we cannot produce a fraction of a pallet, we need to round up x to the nearest integer.\n\nSo, the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is 34.
