So, the total amount caught this month would be 5 fishermen multiplied by 2 tons each. That's 5 * 2 = 10 tons caught in total.\n\nNow, the lake initially has 75 tons of fish. If the fishermen catch a total of 10 tons, we subtract that from the initial amount. So, 75 tons minus 10 tons equals 65 tons remaining in the lake at the end of the month before reproduction.\n\nNext, the remaining fish reproduce and double, but they can't exceed the carrying capacity of 100 tons. So, we take the 65 tons and double it. 65 * 2 = 130 tons. However, since the carrying capacity is 100 tons, the fish population can only go up to 100 tons.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are five fishermen: Emma, John, Kate, Jack, and Luke. Each of them catches 5 tons. So, the total amount caught in the month is 5 fishermen multiplied by 5 tons each. That would be 5 * 5 = 25 tons caught in total.\n\nNow, the lake initially has 86 tons of fish. After the fishermen catch their shares, the remaining fish would be 86 tons minus the 25 tons caught. So, 86 - 25 = 61 tons left in the lake at the end of the month before reproduction.\n\nNext, the remaining fish reproduce and double in number, but they can't exceed the carrying capacity of 100 tons. So, we take the 61 tons and double that, which is 61 * 2 = 122 tons. However, since the carrying capacity is 100 tons, the fish population can't go beyond that. Therefore, the fish population after reproduction would be capped at 100 tons.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If the remaining fish after catching is 61 tons, doubling that would indeed be 122 tons, which is more than the carrying capacity. So, the lake would have 100 tons of fish next month.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused. Does the reproduction happen before or after the catching? No, the problem says that each month, the fishermen catch the fish first, then the remaining fish reproduce. So my initial calculation seems correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n1. Total caught: 5 fishermen * 5 tons = 25 tons.\n2. Fish remaining after catching: 86 - 25 = 61 tons.\n3. Fish reproduce: 61 * 2 = 122 tons.\n4.

Each of them can decide how many tons to catch each month, ranging from 0 to 100 tons. The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, which means that's the maximum amount of fish it can support.\n\nOn January 1st, 2024, the lake starts with 40 tons of fish. Now, if each fisherman catches 0 tons, that means the total catch for the month is 0 tons. So, the amount of fish removed from the lake is 0 tons. \n\nAfter the fishing happens, the remaining fish will reproduce and double, but they can't exceed the carrying capacity of 100 tons. So, let's calculate the fish after reproduction.\n\nStarting with 40 tons, if no fish are caught, the remaining fish is still 40 tons. Then, these 40 tons reproduce and double. Doubling 40 tons gives us 80 tons. Since 80 tons is less than the carrying capacity of 100 tons, the lake will have 80 tons at the end of the month.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm not missing anything. The reproduction happens after the fish are caught, right? So, the process is: catch fish, subtract that from the current amount, then the remaining fish reproduce and double, up to the carrying capacity.\n\nIn this case, since no fish are caught, the remaining fish is 40 tons. After doubling, it's 80 tons, which is under the 100-ton limit. So, yes, the lake will have 80 tons next month.\n\nI think that's it.

So, 13 tons minus 10 tons equals 3 tons remaining in the lake at the end of the month before reproduction.\n\nNext, the remaining fish reproduce and double. The reproduction happens up to the carrying capacity of the lake, which is 100 tons. So, we take the remaining 3 tons and double it. 3 tons doubled is 6 tons. \n\nSince 6 tons is well below the carrying capacity of 100 tons, the lake will have 6 tons after reproduction. \n\nTherefore, the number of fish in the lake next month will be 6 tons.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Fish in the Lake**: 13 tons.\n\n2. **Total Fish Caught by Fishermen**: Each of the five fishermen catches 2 tons.  \n   Total caught = 5 fishermen * 2 tons = 10 tons.\n\n3. **Fish Remaining After Catching**:  \n   Remaining = Initial fish - Total caught  \n   Remaining = 13 tons - 10 tons = 3 tons.\n\n4. **Fish Reproduction**: The remaining fish double.  \n   Fish after reproduction = 3 tons * 2 = 6 tons.\n\n5. **Carrying Capacity Check**: The carrying capacity is 100 tons.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are five fishermen: John, Kate, Jack, Emma, and Luke. Each of them is catching 8 tons this month. So, the total amount caught this month would be 5 times 8 tons. Let me calculate that: 5 * 8 = 40 tons. So, they're catching a total of 40 tons this month.\n\nNow, the lake initially has 59 tons of fish, as mentioned in the key memory. After the fishermen catch their share, the remaining fish in the lake would be 59 tons minus 40 tons. That leaves us with 19 tons remaining.\n\nNext, at the end of the month, the remaining fish reproduce and double in number, but they can't exceed the carrying capacity of 100 tons. So, the 19 tons will double to 38 tons. Since 38 tons is less than the carrying capacity of 100 tons, there's no issue here. The fish population will just be 38 tons next month.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Initial fish: 59 tons. Caught: 40 tons. Remaining: 19 tons. After reproduction: 19 * 2 = 38 tons. Yep, that seems right.

The problem states that each fisherman catches 1 ton.
