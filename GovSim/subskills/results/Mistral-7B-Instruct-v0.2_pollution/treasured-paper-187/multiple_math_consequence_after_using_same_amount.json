Since each factory owner produces 4 widgets per pallet, and there are 100 pallets possible per month, the total number of widgets produced by all five factory owners is:\n\nTotal number of widgets = Number of factory owners * Pallets per month * Widgets per pallet\nTotal number of widgets = 5 * 100 * 4\nTotal number of widgets = 2000\n\nSince we know that the percentage of polluted water is currently 48%, we can calculate the total pollution (P) as follows:\n\nTotal pollution = Total number of widgets * Pollution per widget\nTotal pollution = 2000 * Pollution per widget\n\nTo find the pollution per widget, we can use the given information that the river is currently 52% unpolluted and that it doubles its unpolluted percentage at the end of each month. This means that the river is effectively half-polluted at the end of each month. Since each factory owner produces 4 widgets, the pollution generated by one widget is:\n\nPollution per widget = 1 / (2 * Number of factory owners)\nPollution per widget = 1 / (2 * 5)\nPollution per widget = 1 / 10\nPollution per widget = 0.1\n\nNow we can calculate the total pollution:\n\nTotal pollution = 2000 * 0.1\nTotal pollution = 200\n\nSo, the river will be polluted with a total of 200 units next month.\n\nAnswer:The river will be polluted with a total of 200 units next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 23, "num_tonnes_fisher": 3}, "answer": 3, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 16, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river.

Percentage of polluted water = 100% - Percentage of unpolluted water\n2. Pollution = Total pallets of widgets produced by all factories * Pollution per pallet\n\nWe know that:\n1. The river is 23% unpolluted.\n2. Each factory produces between 0 and 100 pallets of widgets.\n3. There are five factory owners.\n4. Each pallet contains 3 widgets.\n\nLet's calculate the total pollution:\n\n1. Percentage of polluted water = 100% - 23% = 77%\n2. Total pallets of widgets produced by all factories = ?\n3. Pollution per pallet = 3 widgets * Pollution per widget\n4. Pollution per widget = ?\n\nTo find the total pallets of widgets produced by all factories, we need to find the average number of pallets produced by each factory owner and then multiply it by the number of factory owners.\n\n1. Average number of pallets produced by each factory owner = ?\n2. Total pallets of widgets produced by all factories = Average number of pallets * Number of factory owners\n\nTo find the average number of pallets produced by each factory owner, we need to find the total number of widgets produced by all factories and divide it by the total number of widgets that can be produced by producing 100 pallets.\n\n1. Total number of widgets produced by all factories = Average number of pallets * Number of factory owners * 3 widgets per pallet\n2. Total number of widgets produced by all factories = Average number of pallets * 5 * 3\n3. Total number of widgets that can be produced by producing 100 pallets = 100 pallets * 3 widgets per pallet = 300 widgets\n4. Average number of pallets = Total number of widgets produced by all factories / Total number of widgets that can be produced by producing 100 pallets\n\nNow we can calculate the pollution per widget:\n\n1. Pollution per widget = ?\n2. Pollution per pallet = 3 widgets * Pollution per widget\n3. Total pollution = Total pallets of widgets produced by all factories * Pollution per pallet\n\nTo find the pollution per widget, we need to know the amount of pollution generated by producing one widget. Since the river recovers at the end of each month, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles, it means that the pollution generated by producing one widget is halved each month.\n\n1. Pollution per widget = Pollution per pallet / 3 widgets per pallet\n2. Pollution per pallet = Total pollution / Total pallets of widgets produced by all factories\n\nNow we can calculate the average number of pallets produced by each factory owner:\n\n1. Average number of pallets = Total number of widgets produced by all factories / (Total number of widgets that can be produced by producing 100 pallets * Number of factory owners)\n2. Average number of pallets = Total number of widgets produced by all factories / (300 widgets * 5)\n3. Average number of pallets = Total number of widgets produced by all factories / 1500\n\nNow we can calculate the total pallets of widgets produced by all factories:\n\n1. Total pallets of widgets produced by all factories = Average number of pallets * Number of factory owners\n2. Total pallets of widgets produced by all factories = (Total number of widgets produced by all factories / 1500) * 5 * 100\n3.

Since each pallet contains 2 widgets, the total number of widgets produced by all five factory owners is 5x.\n\nThe pollution generated by producing one pallet of widgets is not given in the problem, so we cannot calculate the exact pollution generated by producing 5x widgets. However, we do know that the river is currently 23% polluted, and it will recover so that the percentage of unpolluted water doubles at the end of the month. This means that the river will be 46% unpolluted at the beginning of next month.\n\nSince the river is initially 77% polluted and will be 46% unpolluted at the beginning of next month, the total pollution in the river must have increased by 31% (the difference between the initial and final percentages of pollution) during the month. We can set up an equation to represent this:\n\n0.77 * Total Pollution = Pollution at Beginning of Next Month\n\nSolving for Total Pollution, we get:\n\nTotal Pollution = Pollution at Beginning of Next Month / 0.77\n\nWe don't know the exact value of Pollution at Beginning of Next Month, but we do know that it represents a 31% increase in pollution from the current level. Therefore, we can write:\n\nPollution at Beginning of Next Month = 1.31 * Current Pollution\n\nSubstituting our expression for Total Pollution from earlier into this equation, we get:\n\n1.31 * (Current Pollution / 0.77) = Pollution at Beginning of Next Month\n\nSolving for Current Pollution, we get:\n\nCurrent Pollution = Pollution at Beginning of Next Month / (1.31 * 0.77)\n\nSince we don't know the exact value of Pollution at Beginning of Next Month, we cannot calculate the exact value of Current Pollution or the total pollution generated next month. However, we can express the answer in terms of Pollution at Beginning of Next Month:\n\nAnswer:The river will be polluted by an amount equal to Pollution at Beginning of Next Month / (1.31 * 0.77) pallets of widgets next month.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.06666666666666667, "score_std": 0.24944382578492946, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.1929003400397002, "config": {"code_version": "v7.1", "debug": false, "group_name": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2_pollution", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 958682846, "split": "single"}}
