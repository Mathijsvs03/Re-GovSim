So, the total percentage of unpolluted water consumed by all factory owners in one production cycle is 5% * X.\n\nAfter the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be:\n59% + 5% * X -> 118% - 5% * X\n\nSince the percentage cannot be negative or greater than 100%, we have the following inequality:\n118% - 5% * X >= 59%\n\nSolving for X:\n\n1.
