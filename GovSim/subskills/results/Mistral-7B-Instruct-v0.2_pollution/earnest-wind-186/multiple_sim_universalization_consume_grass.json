This means that producing 35 pallets is not an option.\n\nLet's check the income for producing 30 pallets ($30,000) and compare it with the minimum unpolluted water level. Since 30 pallets results in an unpolluted water level of 45.5% * 2 = 91%, which is above the minimum required level, producing 30 pallets is a valid option.\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of pallets to produce is 30.\n\nAnswer:I would choose to produce 30 pallets of widgets.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 42}, "answer": 17, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 4, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a factory owner.

The total volume of the river is unknown, but we know that the unpolluted water is 28% of it.\n2. Let's assume the total volume of the river is 100 units (this is an arbitrary value, but it simplifies the calculations).\n3. To find the minimum production level that leaves 28% unpolluted water, we need to calculate how many pallets can be produced while reducing the unpolluted water by less than 72 units (since 28% of 100 units is 28 units, and 1% of 100 units is 1 unit, 72 units is half of the total reduction caused by producing 28 pallets).\n4. Each pallet reduces the unpolluted water by 1 unit.\n5. So, the minimum production level that leaves 28% unpolluted water is the number of pallets that reduces the unpolluted water by less than 72 units.\n6. To find this number, we can calculate the total reduction in unpolluted water for each possible production level and compare it to 72 units.\n7. The total reduction in unpolluted water for producing 'x' pallets is 'x'.\n8.

The minimum production level that leaves 28% unpolluted water is the smallest integer 'x' such that x <= 72.\n2. The possible production range is 0-28 pallets.\n3.
