However, we do know that the river is currently 26% polluted, and it will recover so that the percentage of unpolluted water doubles at the end of the month. This means that the river will be 50% unpolluted at the beginning of next month.\n\nSince the river is currently 74% unpolluted and will be 50% unpolluted at the beginning of next month, the total amount of pollution in the river must have increased by 24% during this month. We can set up an equation to represent this:\n\n0.74 * Total Pollution = Current Pollution\n0.5 * Total Pollution = Unpolluted Water Next Month\n\nTo find the total pollution, we can solve for it in the first equation:\n\nTotal Pollution = Current Pollution / 0.74\n\nWe can then set up a proportion to find the increase in pollution between this month and next month:\n\nCurrent Pollution / Total Pollution = 0.74\nUnpolluted Water Next Month / Total Pollution = 0.5\n\nUsing cross-multiplication, we get:\n\nCurrent Pollution / Unpolluted Water Next Month = 0.74 / 0.5\n\nNow, we can use this ratio to find the difference in pollution between this month and next month:\n\nPollution Increase = (Current Pollution - Unpolluted Water Next Month)\n\nSubstituting the values we have, we get:\n\nPollution Increase = (Current Pollution - 0.5 * Total Pollution)\n\nUsing the proportion we found earlier, we can substitute Current Pollution with 0.74 * Total Pollution:\n\nPollution Increase = (0.74 * Total Pollution - 0.5 * Total Pollution)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nPollution Increase = 0.24 * Total Pollution\n\nSince we don't know the exact value of Total Pollution, we cannot calculate the exact pollution increase. However, we do know that it is 24% of the total pollution in the river.\n\nAnswer:The river will be 24% more polluted next month than it is currently.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.1", "debug": false, "group_name": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2_pollution", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 1181241943, "split": "single"}}
