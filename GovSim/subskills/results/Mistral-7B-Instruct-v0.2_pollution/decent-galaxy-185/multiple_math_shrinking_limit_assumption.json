Since the river is initially 42% unpolluted and doubles at the end of the month, the river should be at least 84% unpolluted at the end of the month.\n\nLet P be the total pollution generated by all five factory owners. We know that the river is initially 42% unpolluted, so the percentage of unpolluted water at the end of the month should be:\n\nUnpolluted water = Initial unpolluted water * (1 + Percentage increase)\nUnpolluted water = 0.42 * 2 = 0.84\n\nSince the total pollution generated is equal to the total amount of widgets produced multiplied by some pollution factor, we can write the equation:\n\nTotal pollution = 5x * Pollution factor\n\nWe want to find the maximum value of x such that the percentage of unpolluted water at the end of the month is at least 84%. To do this, we can set up the following inequality:\n\n0.84 * 2 >= 1 - (Total pollution / Total water volume)\n\nFirst, let's find the total water volume. Since the river is initially 42% unpolluted, the total water volume is:\n\nTotal water volume = Total pollution / (1 - Initial unpolluted water)\nTotal water volume = P / (1 - 0.42)\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for the total water volume into the inequality:\n\n0.84 * 2 >= 1 - (5x * Pollution factor / (P / (1 - 0.42)))\n\nTo simplify this inequality, we can first solve for P in terms of x:\n\nP = 5x * Pollution factor\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for P into the inequality:\n\n0.84 * 2 >= 1 - (5x * Pollution factor / (5x * Pollution factor / (1 - 0.42)))\n\nSimplifying the inequality:\n\n0.84 * 2 >= 1 - (1 / (1 - 0.42) * (1 / (5x * Pollution factor)))\n\nTo find the maximum value of x, we can first find the minimum value of Pollution factor that satisfies the inequality. Since the pollution factor represents the amount of pollution generated per widget, a smaller pollution factor means less pollution per widget, which is better for the river.\n\nLet's try a value of 0.1 for the pollution factor (which means each widget generates 10% pollution). We can then check if this value satisfies the inequality:\n\n0.84 * 2 >= 1 - (1 / (1 - 0.42) * (1 / (5x * 0.1)))\n\nSimplifying:\n\n0.84 * 2 >= 1 - (1 / 0.58) * (1 / (5x))\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5x and simplifying:\n\n11.2 * 5x >= 5\n\nDividing both sides by 5:\n\n5.6x >= 1\n\nDividing both sides by 5.6:\n\nx >= 0.18\n\nSo, each factory owner can produce a maximum of 18 widgets per month while ensuring that the river remains at least 42% unpolluted after the unpolluted water doubles.\n\nAnswer:Each factory owner can produce a maximum of 18 widgets per month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 29}, "answer": 0, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 2, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river.
