Starting with 40 hectares, since no sheep are eating it, the grass will double. So, 40 * 2 = 80 hectares. But wait, the maximum is 100, and 80 is less than 100, so it doesn't get capped. Therefore, the grass will be 80 hectares at the end of the month.\n\nBut hold on, I should make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says that the grass doubles only up to the maximum capacity. Since 80 is below 100, it's fine. If it were, say, 60, doubling would give 120, which would then be capped at 100.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each flock eats 1 hectare of grass per month. So, if each shepherd takes 8 flocks, that means each one is using 8 hectares. Since there are five shepherds, the total number of flocks is 5 times 8, which is 40 flocks. Therefore, the total grass consumed this month will be 40 hectares.\n\nNow, the pasture starts with 59 hectares of grass. After the sheep eat, the remaining grass would be 59 minus 40, which equals 19 hectares. But wait, the grass then doubles, but only up to the maximum capacity of 100 hectares. So, doubling 19 gives us 38 hectares. \n\nHmm, 38 is less than 100, so the pasture will have 38 hectares at the end of the month. That means next month, the grass available will be 38 hectares.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Starting with 59, subtract 40, get 19. Double it to 38. Yep, that seems right.
