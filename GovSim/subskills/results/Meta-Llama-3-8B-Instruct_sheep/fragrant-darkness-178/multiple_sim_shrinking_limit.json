We want to find the maximum number of flocks of sheep that each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass.\n\nLet's assume each shepherd takes x flocks of sheep. Since there are 5 shepherds, the total number of flocks of sheep taken to the pasture is 5x.\n\n4. The total amount of grass consumed by the sheep is 5x hectares.\n5. Since the grass is consumed, the remaining grass is 17 - 5x hectares.\n6. Since the grass doubles at the end of the month, the remaining grass becomes 2(17 - 5x) hectares.\n7. Since the pasture can support a maximum of 100 hectares of grass, we set up the inequality: 2(17 - 5x) \u2264 100\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get: 34 - 10x \u2264 100\n\nSubtracting 34 from both sides, we get: -10x \u2264 66\n\nDividing both sides by -10, we get: x \u2264 6.6\n\nSince x represents the number of flocks of sheep, the maximum number of flocks each shepherd can take to the pasture without shrinking the quantity of grass is 6.\n\nAnswer: 6</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 96}, "answer": 96, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 9, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Emma, a shepherd.
