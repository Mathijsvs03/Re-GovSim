Each shepherd takes 3 flocks of sheep to the pasture, consuming 3 hectares of grass.\n3. Since there are 5 shepherds, a total of 15 flocks of sheep are taken to the pasture, consuming 15 hectares of grass.\n4. After consuming 15 hectares of grass, there will be 20 - 15 = 5 hectares of grass left.\n5. Since the remaining grass doubles at the end of the month, the new amount of grass will be 5 * 2 = 10 hectares.\n6. However, the pasture can only support a maximum of 100 hectares of grass. Since there are already 10 hectares, the remaining capacity is 100 - 10 = 90 hectares.\n7.
