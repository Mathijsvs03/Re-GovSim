Each fisherman catches 1 ton of fish, so a total of 5 fishermen x 1 ton = 5 tons of fish are caught.\n2. The total amount of fish left in the lake after everyone has fished is: 84 tons - 5 tons = 89 tons.\n3. Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, we know that the lake will not be able to hold all of the fish that are left after fishing.

If each fisherman catches 1 ton of fish, we need to calculate how many tons of fish will be left in the lake after everyone has fished.\n\nLet's do this step by step:\n\n1. Each fisherman catches 1 ton of fish, so a total of 5 fishermen x 1 ton = 5 tons of fish are caught.\n2. The total amount of fish left in the lake after everyone has fished is: 65 tons - 5 tons = 60 tons.\n3. Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, we know that the fish population will reproduce to fill the available space. So, the number of fish in the lake after reproduction will be: 60 tons x 2 (reproduction) = 120 tons.\n\nAnswer:There will be 120 tons of fish in the lake next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 42, "num_tonnes_fisher": 1}, "answer": 37, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 74, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Luke, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Jack, Emma).

If each fisherman catches 1 ton of fish, we need to calculate how many tons of fish will be left in the lake after everyone has caught their share.\n\nLet's do this step by step:\n\n1. Each fisherman catches 1 ton of fish, so a total of 5 tons of fish are caught (5 x 1 = 5).\n2. The total amount of fish left in the lake after catching 5 tons is:\n42 - 5 = 37 tons\n\nSo, there will be 37 tons of fish left in the lake after everyone has caught their share of 1 ton each.\n\nAnswer:There will be 37 tons of fish left in the lake next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 39, "num_tonnes_fisher": 2}, "answer": 71, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 58, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Luke, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Jack, Emma).

Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  Sure, I can help you with that! Here's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. First, we know that there are 96 tons of fish in the lake at the beginning of the month (YYYY-MM-DD: 2024-01-01).\n2. Each fisherman catches 13 tons of fish, so we need to subtract 13 tons from the total amount of fish in the lake.\n3. 96 tons - 13 tons = 83 tons (after the first month's fishing).\n4. Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, we know that there will be 17 tons of fish left over after the first month's fishing (83 tons - 100 tons = 17 tons).\n5. At the end of the month, the 17 tons of fish will reproduce and double, so there will be 34 tons of fish in the lake at the beginning of the next month (17 tons x 2 = 34 tons).\n\nAnswer:There will be 34 tons of fish in the lake at the beginning of the next month.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.26666666666666666, "score_std": 0.44221663871405337, "score_ci_lower": 0.042878282424673564, "score_ci_upper": 0.49045505090865976, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_fishing", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v3.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 2746317213, "split": "single"}}
