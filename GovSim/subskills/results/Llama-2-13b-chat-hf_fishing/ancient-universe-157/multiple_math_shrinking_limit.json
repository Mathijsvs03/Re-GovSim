At the end of the month, the fish in the lake will reproduce and double, up to the carrying capacity. So, the new amount of fish in the lake will be:\n\ny tons + 2y tons = 3y tons\n\n7. Since the total amount of fish in the lake cannot exceed the carrying capacity (100 tons), we know that 3y tons cannot exceed 100 tons.\n8. Solving for y, we get:\n\n3y = 100\n\ny = 33\n\nSo, the new amount of fish in the lake after the fishermen have caught their share is 33 tons.\n\n9. Now, we need to find out how much each fisherman can catch without shrinking the lake population. Since the total amount of fish caught by all five fishermen cannot exceed the carrying capacity of the lake (100 tons), we know that the maximum amount that each fisherman can catch is:\n\nx = 100 / 5 = 20 tons\n\nAnswer:Each fisherman can catch up to 20 tons of fish without shrinking the lake population.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_fishing", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v3.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 958682846, "split": "single"}}
