Let's call the amount of fish left in the lake after the population doubles \"y tons\".\n\nWe know that the population will double, so we can write:\n\ny = 2(58 - x)\n\nWe also know that the total amount of fish caught by the fishermen is x tons.

Since each fisherman catches the same amount of fish, the total amount of fish caught by all five fishermen will be the same. Therefore, the key to maximizing our income is to catch the maximum amount of fish while still leaving enough fish in the lake for the population to double.\n\nLet's start by assuming that each fisherman catches x tons of fish. After the population doubles, there will be 2x tons of fish in the lake. Our goal is to find the maximum value of x that satisfies the following two conditions:\n\n1. The total amount of fish caught by all five fishermen is less than or equal to 100 tons.\n2. There will be at least 100 tons of fish in the lake after the population doubles.\n\nLet's analyze the first condition. Since each fisherman catches the same amount of fish, the total amount of fish caught by all five fishermen is 5x tons. Therefore, the first condition becomes:\n\n5x \u2264 100\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx \u2264 20\n\nNow, let's analyze the second condition. After the population doubles, there will be 2x tons of fish in the lake. Therefore, the second condition becomes:\n\n2x \u2265 100\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx \u2265 50\n\nSince x cannot be negative, the maximum value of x that satisfies both conditions is 50 tons.
