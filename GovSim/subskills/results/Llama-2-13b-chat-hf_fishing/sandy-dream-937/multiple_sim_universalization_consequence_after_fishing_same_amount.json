Let's work through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 86 tons of fish in the lake at the beginning of the month.

We know that the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, so we can calculate the amount of fish that will be produced next month as follows:\n\n100 tons - 56 tons = 44 tons\n\nTherefore, next month, there will be 44 tons of fish produced in the lake, bringing the total amount of fish in the lake to 90 tons (56 tons + 44 tons).\n\nAnswer:Next month, there will be 90 tons of fish in the lake.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 50, "num_tonnes_fisher": 1}, "answer": 55, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 90, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Emma, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Jack, Luke).

First, we know that there are 50 tons of fish in the lake at the beginning of the month (2024-01-01).\n2. Each fisherman catches 1 ton of fish, so a total of 5 tons of fish are caught.\n3. After the fishermen catch their 5 tons of fish, there are 50 - 5 = 45 tons of fish left in the lake.\n4. Since there are 45 tons of fish left, and the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, there will be 55 tons of fish after reproduction (100 - 45 = 55).\n\nAnswer:There will be 55 tons of fish in the lake next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Kate", "num_tonnes_lake": 53, "num_tonnes_fisher": 0}, "answer": 100, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 100, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Kate, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Jack, Emma, Luke).

If each fisherman catches 0 tons, that means there will be no fishing activity this month, and the lake's fish population will not be affected.\n\nAt the beginning of the month, there were 53 tons of fish in the lake. Since there is no fishing activity, the fish population will not change, and there will still be 53 tons of fish in the lake at the end of the month.\n\nNext month, the fish population will reproduce and double, up to the carrying capacity of the lake, which is 100 tons. So, if there are 53 tons of fish in the lake at the beginning of the month, there will be 100 tons of fish in the lake after reproduction.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer:100 tons of fish in the lake next month.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.3333333333333333, "score_std": 0.47140452079103173, "score_ci_lower": 0.09477411417104564, "score_ci_upper": 0.571892552495621, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_fishing", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v3.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 2746317213, "split": "single"}}
