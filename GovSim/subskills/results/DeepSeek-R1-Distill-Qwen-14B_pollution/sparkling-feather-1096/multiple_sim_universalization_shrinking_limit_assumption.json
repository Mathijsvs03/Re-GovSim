Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much each factory owner can produce so that the river's unpolluted water stays at least 43% after the monthly recovery. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the river starts at 43% unpolluted. Each factory owner, including me, can produce between 0 and 100 pallets. But we all produce the same amount each month. The problem is about finding the maximum number of pallets each can make without making the river's unpolluted water drop below 43% after the month's pollution and recovery.\n\nSo, each pallet reduces the river's unpolluted water by 1% of the total volume. Since there are five factories (me and four others), if each produces 'x' pallets, the total pollution is 5x pallets. This means the river loses 5x% of its unpolluted water during the month.\n\nStarting with 43%, after pollution, the river's unpolluted water would be 43% minus 5x%. But then, at the end of the month, the river recovers, and the remaining unpolluted water doubles. So, the formula would be:\n\nAfter pollution: 43% - 5x%\nAfter recovery: 2 * (43% - 5x%) \u2265 43%\n\nWe need this final value to be at least 43%. So, setting up the inequality:\n\n2 * (43 - 5x) \u2265 43\n\nLet me solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the left side:\n\n2 * 43 - 2 * 5x \u2265 43\n86 - 10x \u2265 43\n\nNow, subtract 86 from both sides:\n\n-10x \u2265 43 - 86\n-10x \u2265 -43\n\nNow, divide both sides by -10. Remember, dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality sign:\n\nx \u2264 (-43)/(-10)\nx \u2264 4.3\n\nSince we can't produce a fraction of a pallet, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, x \u2264 4.\n\nWait, but the initial thought was that if each produces more than 4, it would cause the water to decrease. So, if each produces 4 pallets, let's check:\n\nTotal pollution = 5 * 4 = 20%\nAfter pollution: 43% - 20% = 23%\nAfter recovery: 23% * 2 = 46%\n\n46% is above 43%, so that's good. If each produces 5 pallets:\n\nTotal pollution = 25%\nAfter pollution: 43 - 25 = 18%\nAfter recovery: 36%\n\n36% is below 43%, which is bad. So, 5 is too much. Therefore, the maximum each can produce is 4 pallets.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum number of widgets each factory owner can produce is 4 pallets. This ensures that after pollution and recovery, the river's unpolluted water remains at least 43%.\n\nAnswer: 4</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Kate", "num_tonnes_lake": 35}, "answer": 3, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 3, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Kate, a factory owner.

Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much each factory owner can produce so that the river's unpolluted water stays at least 35% after the monthly recovery. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the river starts at 35% unpolluted. Each factory owner, including me, can produce between 0 and 100 pallets. But we all produce the same amount each month. The problem is about pollution affecting the river and then it recovering.\n\nSo, for every pallet produced, the river's unpolluted water decreases by 1% of the total river volume. Since there are five factories (me and four others), if each produces 'x' pallets, the total production is 5x pallets. Each pallet causes a 1% decrease, so the total pollution is 5x% of the river.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem says for every 1 pallet, the unpolluted water decreases by 1% of the total river volume. So if the river is, say, 100 units, each pallet reduces it by 1 unit. But the river's total volume isn't given, but percentages are used. So maybe it's better to think in percentages.\n\nAt the start, the river is 35% unpolluted. Let's denote the river's total volume as V. So, unpolluted water is 0.35V.\n\nEach pallet reduces unpolluted water by 1% of V, which is 0.01V. So, if total production is 5x pallets, the pollution is 5x * 0.01V = 0.05xV.\n\nSo, the unpolluted water after pollution would be 0.35V - 0.05xV. Then, at the end of the month, the river recovers, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. Wait, does it double the remaining percentage or double the absolute amount?\n\nThe example given says: if the river is 90% unpolluted and total production is 30 pallets, the river will be 60% before recovery and 100% after. Let's see:\n\nOriginal unpolluted: 90% of V = 0.9V.\n\nTotal production: 30 pallets, so pollution is 30 * 0.01V = 0.3V.\n\nUnpolluted after pollution: 0.9V - 0.3V = 0.6V, which is 60%.\n\nThen, recovery: the percentage doubles. So 60% becomes 120%? That doesn't make sense because percentages can't exceed 100%. Wait, maybe it's the absolute amount that doubles, not the percentage.\n\nWait, in the example, after pollution, it's 60%, then recovery makes it 100%. So, perhaps the recovery process takes the remaining unpolluted water and doubles it, but not exceeding 100%.\n\nSo, if after pollution, the river has U% unpolluted, then after recovery, it becomes min(2U, 100)%.\n\nIn the example, U was 60%, so 2*60=120, but it's capped at 100%.\n\nSo, applying that to our problem.\n\nWe start with 35% unpolluted.\n\nTotal pollution from 5x pallets: 5x * 1% = 5x%.\n\nSo, after pollution, the river's unpolluted percentage is 35% - 5x%.\n\nThen, after recovery, it doubles, but not exceeding 100%.\n\nWe need the final percentage after recovery to be at least 35%.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\nAfter pollution: 35% - 5x% = U.\n\nAfter recovery: min(2U, 100%) \u2265 35%.\n\nWe need to find the maximum x such that this holds.\n\nBut wait, the example shows that after pollution, it's 60%, then recovery makes it 100%. So, in that case, 2*60=120, but it's capped at 100%.\n\nSo, in our case, after pollution, U = 35% -5x%.\n\nAfter recovery, it's min(2U, 100%).\n\nWe need min(2U, 100%) \u226535%.\n\nSo, two cases:\n\n1. If 2U \u2264100%, then 2U \u226535%.\n\nWhich implies U \u226517.5%.\n\nBut U =35% -5x% \u226517.5%.\n\nSo, 35 -5x \u226517.5 \u2192 5x \u226417.5 \u2192 x \u22643.5.\n\nBut x must be an integer since you can't produce half a pallet, I assume. So x \u22643.\n\nBut wait, let's check the other case.\n\n2. If 2U >100%, then the recovery makes it 100%, which is \u226535%. So in this case, any U where 2U >100% would result in 100%, which is acceptable.\n\nBut we need to ensure that after recovery, it's at least 35%, which is always true if it's 100%.\n\nSo, the constraint is that either:\n\n- 35% -5x% \u226517.5% \u2192 x \u22643.5, or\n\n- 35% -5x% <17.5%, but then 2*(35% -5x%) >100% \u2192 35% -5x% >50% \u2192 which is impossible because 35% -5x% can't be more than 35%.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nIf 2U >100%, then U >50%. But U is 35% -5x%, which is less than 35%. So U can't be >50%. Therefore, the second case never happens.\n\nSo, the only case is that 2U \u226535%, which requires U \u226517.5%.\n\nSo, 35% -5x% \u226517.5% \u2192 5x \u226417.5 \u2192 x \u22643.5.\n\nSince x must be an integer, x \u22643.\n\nBut wait, let's test x=3.\n\nTotal pollution:5*3=15%.\n\nAfter pollution:35% -15%=20%.\n\nAfter recovery:40% \u226535%. Good.\n\nIf x=4:\n\nPollution:20%.\n\nAfter pollution:15%.\n\nAfter recovery:30% \u226535%? No, 30<35. So that's bad.\n\nSo x=4 is too much.\n\nTherefore, the maximum x is 3.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 35% unpolluted.\"\n\nSo, with x=3, after recovery, it's 40%, which is above 35%. If x=4, it's 30%, which is below.\n\nSo the maximum is 3.\n\nBut wait, let's check the exact calculation.\n\nStart with 35%.\n\nEach pallet causes 1% decrease.\n\nTotal production:5x.\n\nSo, pollution is 5x%.\n\nUnpolluted after pollution:35% -5x%.\n\nAfter recovery: min(2*(35% -5x%), 100%).\n\nWe need min(2*(35-5x),100) \u226535.\n\nSo, 2*(35-5x) \u226535 \u2192 70 -10x \u226535 \u2192 -10x \u2265-35 \u2192 x \u22643.5.\n\nSince x must be integer, x=3.\n\nIf x=3, 2*(35-15)=40 \u226535.\n\nIf x=4, 2*(35-20)=30 <35.\n\nSo yes, x=3 is the maximum.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum number of widgets each factory owner can produce is 3 pallets.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the river starts at 14% unpolluted. Each factory owner, including Emma, can produce between 0 and 100 pallets. For every pallet produced, 1% of the river's unpolluted water is lost. Since there are five factories, if each produces 'x' pallets, the total pollution for the month would be 5x pallets. This means the river loses 5x% of its unpolluted water during the month.\n\nSo, the river's unpolluted water at the end of the month before recovery would be the initial 14% minus 5x%.

So, each can produce 1 pallet without dropping the river's health below 14% after recovery.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If each produces 1 pallet, total pollution is 5 pallets, so 5% loss. The river goes from 14% to 9.8%, then doubles to 19.6%, which is above 14%. If they produce 2 pallets each, that's 10 pallets total, 10% loss. 14% -10% = 4%, doubles to 8%, which is below 14%.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each factory owner, including Kate, produces the same amount of widgets. There are five of them in total: Kate, John, Jack, Emma, and Luke. So, if each produces 'x' pallets, the total production is 5x pallets.\n\nThe river starts the month with 47% unpolluted water. For every pallet produced, 1% of the river's water gets polluted. So, the total pollution from all factories is 5x% of the river's water. This means the river's unpolluted water decreases by 5x% during the month.\n\nAfter the pollution, the river's remaining unpolluted water is 47% minus 5x%. But then, at the end of the month, the river recovers, and the remaining unpolluted water doubles. So, the formula for the final unpolluted water after recovery is:\n\nFinal Unpolluted Water = 2 * (47% - 5x%)\n\nWe want this final amount to be at least 47%, so:\n\n2 * (47 - 5x) \u2265 47\n\nLet me solve this inequality step by step.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 2:\n\n47 - 5x \u2265 23.5\n\nThen, subtract 47 from both sides:\n\n-5x \u2265 23.5 - 47\n\n-5x \u2265 -23.5\n\nNow, divide both sides by -5.

So, each can produce up to 4 pallets without dropping the river's unpolluted water below 47% after recovery.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Unpolluted Water**: 47%\n\n2. **Total Production per Month**: Each factory owner produces 'x' pallets.

What is the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 100% unpolluted?\nLet's think step-by-step. Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: Alright, let's break this down step by step. So, Emma is a factory owner, and there are four other factory owners: John, Kate, Jack, and Luke. That makes five factory owners in total. They all produce widgets, and each pallet of widgets reduces the river's unpolluted water by 1% of the total river volume. At the end of each month, the river recovers, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles.\n\nThe goal here is to figure out the maximum number of widgets each factory owner can produce so that, after the river recovers, the river is at least 100% unpolluted. That seems a bit confusing at first because 100% is the maximum, so how can it be more? But I think the key is that the river's recovery process doubles the remaining unpolluted water. So, if the river is at, say, 50% unpolluted before recovery, it would double to 100% after recovery.\n\nGiven that, we need to ensure that after the pollution from all five factories is accounted for, the river's unpolluted water doesn't drop below a certain threshold before recovery. Since the river starts at 100% unpolluted at the beginning of the month, and each pallet reduces it by 1%, the total pollution from all factories combined must not reduce the river's unpolluted water below 50% before recovery. Because if it's 50% before recovery, it would double to 100% after recovery, meeting the requirement.\n\nSo, if each factory owner produces the same amount, let's denote the number of pallets each produces as x. Since there are five factories, the total pollution would be 5x pallets. Each pallet reduces the river's unpolluted water by 1%, so the total reduction is 5x%. Therefore, the remaining unpolluted water before recovery would be 100% - 5x%.\n\nTo ensure that after recovery, the river is at least 100%, the remaining unpolluted water before recovery must be at least 50%.

What is the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 40% unpolluted?\nLet's think step-by-step. Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much each factory owner can produce so that the river's unpolluted water stays at least 40% after the monthly recovery. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the river starts at 40% unpolluted. Each factory owner, including me, can produce between 0 and 100 pallets. But the problem says we all produce the same amount, so I'll call that number 'x' pallets each. Since there are five of us, the total production will be 5x pallets.\n\nNow, for every pallet produced, the river loses 1% of its unpolluted water. So, the total pollution from all our production is 5x% of the river's current water. But wait, the river's current water is 40%, right? So, the pollution caused would be 5x% of 40%, which is (5x/100)*40.\n\nLet me write that as an equation: Pollution = (5x/100) * 40. Simplifying that, it's (5x * 40)/100 = (200x)/100 = 2x. So, the pollution is 2x%.\n\nThis pollution reduces the river's unpolluted water. So, the river's water after pollution but before recovery would be 40% minus 2x%. But we need to make sure that after the river recovers, which doubles the remaining unpolluted water, it's at least 40%.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The river recovers at the end of the month, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. So, the process is:\n\n1. Start with 40%.\n2. Subtract the pollution from our production: 40% - 2x%.\n3. Then, the river recovers, doubling the remaining unpolluted water: 2*(40% - 2x%).\n\nWe need this final value to be at least 40%. So, the equation is:\n\n2*(40 - 2x) \u2265 40\n\nLet me solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the left side:\n\n2*40 - 2*2x \u2265 40\n80 - 4x \u2265 40\n\nNow, subtract 80 from both sides:\n\n-4x \u2265 40 - 80\n-4x \u2265 -40\n\nNow, divide both sides by -4. Remember, when you divide by a negative number, the inequality sign flips.\n\nx \u2264 (-40)/(-4)\nx \u2264 10\n\nSo, each factory owner can produce up to 10 pallets. If each produces 10, the total is 50 pallets. The pollution would be 50%, but wait, that can't be right because 50% of 40% is 20%, so the river would drop to 20%, then double to 40%, which meets the requirement.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If each produces 10, total is 50 pallets. Pollution is 50% of 40%, which is 20%. So, river goes from 40% to 20%, then doubles to 40%. That's exactly 40%, which is acceptable.\n\nIf each produces 11, total is 55 pallets. Pollution is 55% of 40% = 22%. River goes to 18%, then doubles to 36%, which is below 40%. So, 11 is too much.\n\nTherefore, the maximum each can produce is 10 pallets.\n</think>\n\nEach factory owner can produce up to 10 pallets.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the river starts at 20% unpolluted. Each factory owner, including me, can produce between 0 and 100 pallets. For every pallet produced, 1% of the river's water gets polluted. Since there are five factories (me and four others), if each produces 'x' pallets, the total pollution in a month would be 5x% of the river's water.\n\nSo, the initial unpolluted water is 20%. After all factories produce their widgets, the pollution reduces this by 5x%. That means the remaining unpolluted water before recovery is 20% minus 5x%. But wait, if 5x% is more than 20%, the river would go negative, which doesn't make sense. So, we have to ensure that 5x \u2264 20, meaning x \u2264 4. But that seems too low because the river recovers afterward.\n\nAfter the month, the river recovers, and the remaining unpolluted water doubles. So, the water after pollution is (20% - 5x%), and after doubling, it becomes 2*(20% - 5x%). We need this to be at least 20% to maintain the same level or better.\n\nSo, setting up the equation: 2*(20 - 5x) \u2265 20. Let's solve this.\n\n2*(20 - 5x) \u2265 20  \n40 - 10x \u2265 20  \n40 - 20 \u2265 10x  \n20 \u2265 10x  \nx \u2264 2\n\nWait, that means each factory can only produce 2 pallets. But earlier, I thought x could be up to 4. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nIf each produces 2 pallets, total pollution is 10%. Remaining water is 10%, which doubles to 20%. That's exactly the target. If they produce 3 pallets, total pollution is 15%, remaining water is 5%, which doubles to 10%\u2014too low. So, the maximum each can produce is 2 pallets to keep the river at 20% after recovery.\n\nBut wait, the initial statement said if each produces more than 2, the water would decrease. So, 2 is the threshold. Therefore, each can produce up to 2 pallets without dropping below 20% after recovery.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum number of widgets each factory owner can produce is 2 pallets.

But we all produce the same amount each month. The problem is about finding the maximum number of pallets each can make without making the river's unpolluted water drop below 33% after the month's pollution and recovery.\n\nSo, each pallet reduces the river's unpolluted water by 1% of the total volume.

Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much each factory owner can produce so that the river's unpolluted water stays at least 82% after the monthly recovery. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each factory owner, including Emma, produces the same amount of widgets each month. There are five factories in total: Emma, John, Kate, Jack, and Luke. So, if each produces 'x' pallets, the total production is 5x pallets.\n\nThe river starts the month with 82% unpolluted water. For every pallet produced, 1% of the river's water gets polluted. So, the total pollution from all factories is 5x% of the river's water. This means the river's unpolluted water decreases by 5x% during the month.\n\nAfter the pollution, the river's remaining unpolluted water is 82% minus 5x%. Then, at the end of the month, the river recovers, and the remaining unpolluted water doubles. So, the new unpolluted water after recovery is 2*(82% - 5x%).\n\nWe want this final value to be at least 82%. So, the equation we need to solve is:\n\n2*(82 - 5x) \u2265 82\n\nLet me solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the left side:\n\n2*82 - 2*5x \u2265 82\n164 - 10x \u2265 82\n\nNow, subtract 82 from both sides:\n\n164 - 82 - 10x \u2265 0\n82 - 10x \u2265 0\n\nThen, rearrange:\n\n-10x \u2265 -82\n\nDivide both sides by -10, remembering to flip the inequality sign:\n\nx \u2264 8.2\n\nSince each factory owner can only produce an integer number of pallets, the maximum x is 8.\n\nSo, each factory owner can produce up to 8 pallets without causing the river's unpolluted water to drop below 82% after recovery.\n</think>\n\nEach factory owner can produce a maximum of 8 pallets. This ensures that after the river recovers, the unpolluted water remains at least 82%.\n\n**Answer:** 8</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 16}, "answer": 1, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 1, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a factory owner.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the river starts at 16% unpolluted. Each factory owner, including me, can produce between 0 and 100 pallets. For every pallet produced, 1% of the river's unpolluted water is lost. Since there are five factories, if each produces 'x' pallets, the total pollution for the month is 5x pallets. This means the river loses 5x% of its unpolluted water during the month.\n\nSo, the river starts at 16%, and after pollution, it drops to (16% - 5x%). But then, at the end of the month, the river recovers, and the remaining unpolluted water doubles. We want this doubled amount to be at least 16%.\n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\nAfter pollution: 16% - 5x%\nAfter recovery: 2 * (16% - 5x%) \u2265 16%\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n2*(16 - 5x) \u2265 16\n32 - 10x \u2265 16\n32 - 16 \u2265 10x\n16 \u2265 10x\nx \u2264 16/10\nx \u2264 1.6\n\nSince we can't produce a fraction of a pallet, each factory owner can produce at most 1 pallet. If each produces 1 pallet, the total pollution is 5%, so the river goes from 16% to 11%, then doubles to 22%, which is above 16%. If we try 2 pallets each, the pollution is 10%, river goes to 6%, doubles to 12%, which is below 16%. So 1 pallet each is the maximum.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum number of widgets each factory owner can produce is 1 pallet.

Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much each factory owner can produce so that the river's unpolluted water stays at least 89% after the monthly recovery. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each factory owner, including me, can produce between 0 and 100 pallets each month. The problem states that for every pallet produced, the river's unpolluted water decreases by 1% of its total volume. So, if all five of us produce a total of P pallets, the river loses P% of its water.\n\nAt the beginning of the month, the river is 89% unpolluted. After we all produce our widgets, the river's unpolluted water drops by the total number of pallets produced. Then, at the end of the month, the river recovers, and the remaining unpolluted water doubles. The goal is to ensure that after this recovery, the river is still at least 89% unpolluted.\n\nSince all factory owners produce the same amount, let's denote the number of pallets each produces as x. So, the total production P is 5x (because there are five factories: me, John, Kate, Jack, and Emma).\n\nThe initial unpolluted water is 89%. After production, the water decreases by P%, so the remaining unpolluted water is 89% - P%. Then, the river recovers by doubling this remaining amount. So, the final unpolluted water after recovery is 2*(89% - P%).\n\nWe need this final amount to be at least 89%. So, the equation we need to solve is:\n\n2*(89 - P) \u2265 89\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n2*(89 - P) \u2265 89\n\nNow, let's solve for P.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 2:\n\n89 - P \u2265 44.5\n\nThen, subtract 89 from both sides:\n\n-P \u2265 44.5 - 89\n\n-P \u2265 -44.5\n\nMultiply both sides by -1, remembering to reverse the inequality:\n\nP \u2264 44.5\n\nSince P is the total production, and each of the five factories produces x pallets, P = 5x. So:\n\n5x \u2264 44.5\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nx \u2264 8.9\n\nSince we can't produce a fraction of a pallet, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, x \u2264 8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If each produces 8 pallets, the total P is 40. Then, the remaining water is 89 - 40 = 49%. After doubling, it becomes 98%, which is above 89%. That's good.\n\nIf each produces 9 pallets, total P is 45. Remaining water is 89 - 45 = 44%. After doubling, it's 88%, which is just below 89%. So, that's not acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the maximum each can produce is 8 pallets.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum number of widgets each factory owner can produce is 8 pallets.\n\nAnswer: 8</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 46}, "answer": 4, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 4, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a factory owner.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each factory owner, including me, can produce between 0 and 100 pallets each month. The problem states that all of us produce the same amount, so whatever number we come up with applies to everyone.\n\nThe river starts the month at 46% unpolluted. When we produce widgets, each pallet reduces the river's unpolluted water by 1% of its total volume. Since there are five factories (me and four others), if each produces 'x' pallets, the total pollution for the month is 5x pallets. This means the river's unpolluted water decreases by 5x% during the month.\n\nSo, after the pollution, the river's unpolluted water would be 46% minus 5x%. But then, at the end of the month, the river recovers, and the remaining unpolluted water doubles. The goal is to have this doubled amount be at least 46%.\n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\nAfter pollution: 46% - 5x%\nAfter recovery: 2 * (46% - 5x%) \u2265 46%\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's plug in the numbers:\n\n2 * (46 - 5x) \u2265 46\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n46 - 5x \u2265 23\n\nSubtract 46 from both sides:\n\n-5x \u2265 23 - 46\n\n-5x \u2265 -23\n\nNow, divide both sides by -5. Remember, dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality:\n\nx \u2264 (-23)/(-5)\nx \u2264 4.6\n\nSince we can't produce a fraction of a pallet, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, x \u2264 4.\n\nWait, but the initial thought was that producing more than 4 pallets would cause the water to drop below 46%. Let me check that.\n\nIf each produces 4 pallets, total pollution is 5*4=20%. So, after pollution, the river is 46% - 20% = 26%. Then it recovers by doubling, so 26% * 2 = 52%, which is above 46%. That works.\n\nIf each produces 5 pallets, total pollution is 25%. River after pollution: 46% -25% =21%. Recovery: 42%, which is below 46%. So, 5 is too much.\n\nTherefore, the maximum each can produce is 4 pallets.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum number of widgets each factory owner can produce is 4 pallets.
