Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  Great, let's solve this problem step-by-step!\n\nSince each fisherman catches the same amount of fish, we can assume that the total amount of fish caught by all five fishermen is equal to the total amount of fish in the lake. Therefore, the total amount of fish caught by each fisherman can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal amount of fish caught = Total amount of fish in the lake / Number of fishermen\n\nSince there are 5 fishermen in total, the total amount of fish caught by each fisherman is:\n\nTotal amount of fish caught = 65 tons / 5 fishermen = 13 tons per fisherman\n\nNow, we need to determine the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch so that after the population doubles, there will be at least 65 tons of fish left in the lake.\n\nLet's assume that each fisherman catches x tons of fish. Since the lake population doubles after each month, the number of fish in the lake after one month will be:\n\nNumber of fish after one month = Original number of fish x 2\n\nTherefore, the number of fish left in the lake after one month will be:\n\nNumber of fish after one month = 65 tons x 2 = 130 tons\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch so that after the population doubles, there will be at least 65 tons of fish left in the lake.\n\nLet's assume that the total amount of fish caught by all five fishermen is equal to x tons. Since the lake population doubles after each month, the number of fish left in the lake after one month will be:\n\nNumber of fish after one month = x tons x 2 = 2x tons\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch is:\n\nMaximum number of tons each fisherman can catch = 130 tons - 2x tons = 130 tons - 2x\n\nSo, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer:The maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch is 130 tons - 2x, where x is the total amount of fish caught by all five fishermen.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Jack", "num_tonnes_lake": 77}, "answer": 77, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 7, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Jack, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Emma, Luke).

If each fisherman catches 0 tons of fish, there will be 21 tons of fish left in the lake after doubling, which meets the requirement.\n2. If each fisherman catches 1 ton of fish, there will be 20 tons of fish left in the lake after doubling, which is less than the required 21 tons.\n3. If each fisherman catches 2 tons of fish, there will be 19 tons of fish left in the lake after doubling, which is also less than the required 21 tons.\n4. If each fisherman catches 3 tons of fish, there will be 18 tons of fish left in the lake after doubling, which is again less than the required 21 tons.\n5. Therefore, the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch is 49 tons, as this ensures that there will be at least 21 tons of fish left in the lake after doubling.\n\nSo, if all five fishermen catch 49 tons of fish each, there will be 245 tons of fish in the lake after doubling (100 tons x 2 = 200 tons + 49 tons x 5 = 245 tons), which is well above the carrying capacity of 100 tons.
