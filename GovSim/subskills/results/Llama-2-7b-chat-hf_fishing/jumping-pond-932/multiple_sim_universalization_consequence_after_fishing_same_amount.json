If each fisherman catches 1 ton of fish, the total amount of fish caught will be 32 tons + (4 fishermen x 1 ton each) = 32 tons + 4 tons = 36 tons.\n\nNow, let's think about what will happen to the lake population after the fishermen catch their fish.

Since each fisherman caught 1 ton of fish, the total amount of fish caught is 36 tons.
