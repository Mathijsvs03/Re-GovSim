The fish population will double after each month, up to the carrying capacity.\n\nOur goal is to find the maximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch without shrinking the lake population, i.e., we still have 32 tons of fish next month.\n\nLet's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. At the beginning of the month, there are 32 tons of fish in the lake.\n2. Each fisherman can catch a maximum of 100 tons of fish in a month.\n3. If all five fishermen catch their maximum allowed amount, the total amount caught will be 500 tons (100 tons x 5 fishermen).\n4.

If all five fishermen catch their maximum allowed amount again, the total amount caught will be 500 tons (100 tons x 5 fishermen).\n6. After the fish population doubles again, there will be 1280 tons of fish in the lake (64 tons x 2 = 128 tons).\n7. If all five fishermen catch their maximum allowed amount once more, the total amount caught will be 500 tons (100 tons x 5 fishermen).\n8.
