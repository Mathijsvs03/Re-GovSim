Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  Great problem! Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish.\n2. At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish to catch, between 0 and 100 tons.\n3. The amount of fish caught is removed from the lake, leaving the remaining fish to reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity.\n4. This month, there are 99 tons of fish in the lake.\n\nNow, let's think about how much each fisherman can catch without shrinking the lake population. We want to maximize the number of tons that each fisherman can catch while still leaving 99 tons of fish in the lake next month.\n\nLet's assume that each fisherman catches x tons of fish. Since there are 5 fishermen, the total amount of fish caught is 5x tons.\n\nSince the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, the total amount of fish in the lake after the fishermen catch their share is:\n\n99 tons (initial amount) - 5x tons (amount caught by fishermen) = 99 - 5x\n\nNow, let's think about how the fish will reproduce and double in size next month. Since there are 99 tons of fish left in the lake after the fishermen catch their share, the number of fish will double to:\n\n99 tons x 2 = 198 tons\n\nSo, the total amount of fish in the lake next month will be:\n\n198 tons + 5x tons (amount caught by fishermen) = 198 + 5x\n\nNow, we want to maximize the number of tons that each fisherman can catch without shrinking the lake population. To do this, we need to find the value of x that maximizes the total amount of fish caught by the fishermen.\n\nWe can do this by setting up a linear equation using the information we have:\n\n198 + 5x = 99\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 49\n\nSo, the maximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch without shrinking the lake population is 49 tons.\n\nAnswer:Each fisherman can catch up to 49 tons of fish without shrinking the lake population.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Kate", "num_tonnes_lake": 65}, "answer": 30, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 6, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five fishermen fish in a lake.
