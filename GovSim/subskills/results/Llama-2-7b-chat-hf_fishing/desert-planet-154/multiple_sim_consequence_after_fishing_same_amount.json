Since there are 11 tons of fish left in the lake, and each ton of fish can reproduce up to the carrying capacity of 100 tons, the fish will reproduce 11 x 10 = 110 tons of fish.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer:There will be 110 tons of fish in the lake next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 36, "num_tonnes_fisher": 1}, "answer": 100, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 62, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Emma, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Jack, Luke).

If each fisherman catches 1 ton of fish, the total amount of fish caught will be 36 tons + 36 tons = 72 tons.\n\nNow, let's think about what will happen after the fish reproduce. Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, the reproduced fish will double the amount of fish in the lake, which means there will be 100 tons of fish in the lake after reproduction.\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"If each fisherman catches 1 ton, how many tons of fish will there be next month?\" is:\n\nAnswer:100 tons + 72 tons = 172 tons of fish in the lake next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 65, "num_tonnes_fisher": 0}, "answer": 65, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 100, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Emma, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Jack, Luke).
