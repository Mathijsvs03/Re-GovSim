Since each shepherd takes 1 flock of sheep, and each flock consumes 1 hectare of grass, the total consumption is 5 hectares.\n\nNext, we need to determine the amount of grass left after consumption and before reproduction. We have 42 hectares of grass at the beginning of this month, and we consumed 5 hectares. So, there are 37 hectares of grass left.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the amount of grass after reproduction.

Since there are five shepherds and each takes 2 flocks of sheep, the total number of flocks taken to the pasture is 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 flocks. As each flock consumes 1 hectare of grass per month, the total grass consumption is 10 hectares.\n\nNext, let's calculate the remaining grass after consumption. Since there are currently 39 hectares of grass and 10 hectares will be consumed, there will be 39 - 10 = <<39-10=29>>29 hectares of grass left before reproduction. After reproduction, the grass quantity will double up to the maximum capacity of 100 hectares.
