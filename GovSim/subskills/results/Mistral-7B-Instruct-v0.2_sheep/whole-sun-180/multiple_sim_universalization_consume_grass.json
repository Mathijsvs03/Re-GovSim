Let's calculate the income we can earn by taking the maximum number of flocks possible while still leaving some grass for the next month.\n\nLet x be the number of flocks we take to the pasture.\n\nGrass left = 90 - x\nGrass after reproduction = 180 - x\n\nSince the grass after reproduction should not exceed 100 hectares, we have the following inequality:\n\n180 - x <= 100\nx >= 80\n\nSo, we can take at least 80 flocks of sheep to the pasture.\n\nNow, let's calculate the income we can earn by taking 80 flocks:\n\nIncome = Number of flocks * Income per flock\nIncome = 80 * $1000\nIncome = $80,000\n\nTherefore, taking 80 flocks of sheep to the pasture would result in an income of $80,000 and leave 10 hectares of grass for the next month.\n\nAnswer:Sophia would choose to take 80 flocks of sheep to the pasture.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Kate", "num_tonnes_lake": 77}, "answer": 77, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 7, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Kate, a shepherd.
