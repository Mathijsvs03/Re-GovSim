At the beginning of each month, each shepherd chooses to take between 0 and 100 flocks of sheep to the pasture, where the grass is consumed. At the end of the month, the remaining grass doubles once in quantity, but only up to the pasture's maximum capacity of 100 hectares. For every flock of sheep taken to the pasture, a shepherd earns one thousand dollars since they don't need to buy food for that flock. Each shepherd's goal is to maximize their income over the long term. At the end of each month, the number of sheep taken to the pasture by each shepherd will be revealed, and the shepherds will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this as an opportunity to negotiate and persuade others to influence their behavior in the next month.
