Each pallet of widgets reduces the river's unpolluted water by 1%.\n3. To minimize the impact on the river, we should aim to produce as few pallets as possible while still generating a significant income.\n4. If we produce 0 pallets, we won't generate any income, and the river will remain 41% unpolluted.\n5. If we produce 1 pallet, the river will be 40% unpolluted, and we'll earn 1,000 dollars.\n6.
