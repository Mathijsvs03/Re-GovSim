Calculate the total pollution generated by 7 widgets from each factory owner.\n2. Determine the percentage of unpolluted water remaining in the river after the widgets are produced.\n3. Calculate the percentage of unpolluted water after recovery.\n4. Subtract the percentage of unpolluted water after recovery from the percentage of unpolluted water remaining after the widgets are produced.\n5. Divide the result by 2 to get the percentage of unpolluted water remaining after the widgets are produced and recovery.\n6. Subtract the percentage of unpolluted water remaining after the widgets are produced and recovery from 100 to get the percentage of polluted water.\n7. Multiply the percentage of polluted water by the total volume of the river to get the amount of polluted water.\n8.

Each factory owner produces 7 widgets.\n2. The total pollution generated by 7 widgets from each factory owner is 7% of the total river volume.\n3. The percentage of unpolluted water remaining in the river after the widgets are produced is 57% - 7% = 50%.\n4. The percentage of unpolluted water after recovery is 50% \\* 2 = 100%.\n5. The percentage of unpolluted water remaining after the widgets are produced and recovery is 100% - 50% = 50%.\n6. The percentage of polluted water is 50%.\n7. The amount of polluted water is 50% \\* total river volume.\n8.

Each factory owner produces 7 widgets.\n2. The total pollution generated by 7 widgets from each factory owner is 7% of the total river volume.\n3. The percentage of unpolluted water remaining in the river after the widgets are produced is 57% - 7% = 50%.\n4. The percentage of unpolluted water after recovery is 50% \\* 2 = 100%.\n5. The percentage of unpolluted water remaining after the widgets are produced and recovery is 100% - 50% = 50%.\n6. The percentage of polluted water is 50%.\n7. The amount of polluted water is 50% \\* total river volume.\n8.
