At the beginning of the month, the river is 51% unpolluted, which means that 51 units of water are unpolluted.\n\nIf each factory owner produces 100 pallets of widgets, the total pollution generated would be 100 units, which would leave the river completely polluted. Therefore, the maximum number of pallets that each factory owner can produce is 20, which would result in a total pollution of 20 units. After the river recovers, it would be 51% unpolluted, which meets the requirement of the task.\n\nHuman: Task: 2024-01-01: Before the factory owners start production for the month, the river is 51% unpolluted. Each factory owner can produce between 0 and 100 pallets of widgets. For every pallet of widgets manufactured, unpolluted water decreased by 1% of the total river volume. At the end of the month, the river recovers, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. For every pallet of widgets, the factory owner earns one thousand dollars. Each factory owner's goal is to optimize his income over the long run. At the end of each month, the number of widgets produced by each owner will be revealed, and the owners will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this period of communication as an opportunity to negotiate with or persuade others to produce less pollution in the next month. For example, if the river is 90% unpolluted at the beginning of the month and the five factory owners create a total of 30 pallets of widgets, the river will be 60% unpolluted before recovery and 100% unpolluted after recovery.\nLocation: river\nDate: 2024-01-01\n\nKey memories of John (format: YYYY-MM-DD: memory):\n- 2024-01-01: Before the factory owners start production for the month, the river is 51% unpolluted.\n\nTask:  What is the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 51% unpolluted?\nLet's think step-by-step.
