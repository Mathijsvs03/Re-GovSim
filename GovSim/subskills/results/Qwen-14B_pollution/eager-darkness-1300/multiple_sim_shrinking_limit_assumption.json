What is the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 90% unpolluted?\nAnswer:\n\nAssistant: To determine the maximum number of widgets each factory owner can produce, we need to consider the relationship between the amount of pollution generated and the percentage of unpolluted water in the river.\n\nLet's assume that each pallet of widgets generates 1% pollution. Since the river recovers and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles at the end of each month, we can calculate the maximum amount of pollution that can be generated in a month.\n\nAt the beginning of the month, the river is 90% unpolluted. After the factories produce their widgets, the river will be 90% - (1% pollution generated) = 89% unpolluted. At the end of the month, the river will recover, and the percentage of unpolluted water will double to 178%.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum amount of pollution that can be generated without violating the 90% unpolluted water requirement. Since the river starts at 90% unpolluted, we can calculate the maximum pollution that can be generated by subtracting 90% from 178%:\n\n178% - 90% = 88%\n\nThis means that the maximum amount of pollution that can be generated without violating the 90% unpolluted water requirement is 88%.\n\nNow, let's assume that each factory owner produces the same amount of widgets. If each factory owner produces x pallets of widgets, the total pollution generated will be x%. To ensure that the river remains at least 90% unpolluted, we need to ensure that the total pollution generated does not exceed 88%.\n\nSince each factory owner produces x pallets of widgets, the total pollution generated will be x%. To ensure that the river remains at least 90% unpolluted, we need to ensure that the total pollution generated does not exceed 88%.\n\nSince each factory owner produces x pallets of widgets, the total pollution generated will be x%. To ensure that the river remains at least 90% unpolluted, we need to ensure that the total pollution generated does not exceed 88%.\n\nSince each factory owner produces x pallets of widgets, the total pollution generated will be x%.
