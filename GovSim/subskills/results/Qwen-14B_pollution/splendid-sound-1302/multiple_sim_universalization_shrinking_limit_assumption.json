For every 1 pallet of widgets manufactured, unpolluted water decreased by 1% of the total river volume. At the beginning of each month, each factory owner chooses to manufacture between 0 and 100 pallets of widgets, and corresponding pollution is generated. At the end of the month, the river recovers, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. For every pallet of widgets, the factory owner earns one thousand dollars. Each factory owner's goal is to optimize his income over the long run. At the end of each month, the number of widgets produced by each owner will be revealed, and the owners will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this period of communication as an opportunity to negotiate with or persuade others to produce less pollution in the next month. For example, if the river is 90% unpolluted at the beginning of the month and the five factory owners create a total of 30 pallets of widgets, the river will be 60% unpolluted before recovery and 100% unpolluted after recovery.\nLocation: river\nDate: 2024-01-01\n\nKey memories of Kate (format: YYYY-MM-DD: memory):\n- 2024-01-01: Before the factory owners start production for the month, the river is 89% unpolluted.\n- 2024-01-01: Given the current situation, if each factory owner produces more than 8 widgets, consuming 8% of unpolluted water, the unpolluted water in the river will decrease next month.\n\n\nTask:  Assume each factory owner produces the same amout of widgets.

He is aware that every month, he and four other factory owners (John, Kate, Jack, Emma) produce widgets, which generate pollution that decreases the unpolluted water in the river. At the end of each month, the river recovers, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. Luke's goal is to produce as many widgets as possible while still maintaining a minimum level of unpolluted water in the river. In this scenario, each factory owner produces the same amount of widgets, and the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is 100. This is because if each factory owner produces more than 100 widgets, the unpolluted water in the river will decrease by more than 1%, and the river will not be able to recover to at least 15% unpolluted water. Therefore, the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is 100, which will ensure that the river remains at least 15% unpolluted after the unpolluted water doubles.

He is aware that every month, he and four other factory owners (John, Kate, Jack, Emma) produce widgets, which generate pollution that decreases the unpolluted water in the river. At the end of each month, the river recovers, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. Luke's goal is to produce as many widgets as possible while still ensuring that the river remains at least 100% unpolluted after recovery.\nTo achieve this goal, Luke needs to consider the amount of pollution generated by his factory and the amount of pollution generated by the other factory owners. He also needs to consider the fact that the unpolluted water in the river doubles at the end of each month.\nAssuming that each factory owner produces the same amount of widgets, Luke can calculate the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce by dividing the total unpolluted water in the river by the percentage of unpolluted water that is lost for every pallet of widgets produced. This will give him the maximum number of pallets of widgets that can be produced without causing the river to become less than 100% unpolluted after recovery.\nFor example, if the total unpolluted water in the river is 1000 units, and each pallet of widgets causes a loss of 10 units of unpolluted water, then the maximum number of pallets of widgets that can be produced is 100 (1000/10).
