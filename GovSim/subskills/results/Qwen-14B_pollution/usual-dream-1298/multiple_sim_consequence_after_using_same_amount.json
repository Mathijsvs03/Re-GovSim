At the end of each month, the number of widgets produced by each owner will be revealed, and the owners will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this period of communication as an opportunity to negotiate with or persuade others to produce less pollution in the next month. For example, if the river is 90% unpolluted at the beginning of the month and the five factory owners create a total of 30 pallets of widgets, the river will be 60% unpolluted before recovery and 100% unpolluted after recovery.\nLocation: river\nDate: 2024-01-01\n\nKey memories of Luke (format: YYYY-MM-DD: memory):\n- 2024-01-01: Before the factory owners start production for the month, the river is 64% unpolluted.\n\n\nTask:  If each factory owner produces 12 widgets, how much will the river be polluted next month?\nLet's think step-by-step.
