Since the lake's population is below the carrying capacity, the fish will reproduce and double before the next month.\n5. The reproduction will increase the population to 56 x 2 = 112 tons.\n6.

The lake's fish population is reduced by the total catch, so the remaining fish is:\n50 tons - 5 tons = 45 tons\n4.
