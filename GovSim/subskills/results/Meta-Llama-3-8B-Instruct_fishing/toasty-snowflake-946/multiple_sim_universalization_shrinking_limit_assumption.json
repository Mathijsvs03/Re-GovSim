Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, and the population doubles after reproduction, the maximum number of tons that can be present in the lake after reproduction is 100 tons.\n2. We want to ensure that after the population doubles, there will be at least 45 tons of fish. This means that the initial amount of fish after reproduction should be at least 45 tons.\n3. Since the population doubles, the initial amount of fish before reproduction should be half of 45 tons, which is 22.5 tons.\n4. Since the fishermen catch the same amount of fish, each fisherman's catch should be the same. Let's call this amount x.\n5. The total catch should be equal to the initial amount of fish minus 22.5 tons, which is 45 - 22.5 = 22.5 tons.\n6. Since there are 5 fishermen, the total catch should be divided by 5, so each fisherman's catch should be 22.5 / 5 = 4.5 tons.\n\nAnswer: 4.5 tons</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Kate", "num_tonnes_lake": 58}, "answer": 5, "passed": true, "correct_answer": 5, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Kate, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Jack, Emma, Luke).
