At the beginning of the month, there are 97 tons of fish in the lake.\n3. The fish will reproduce and double, up to the carrying capacity of 100 tons.\n4. To find the maximum amount each fisherman can catch, we need to find the maximum amount that will leave at least 97 tons of fish after doubling.\n\nLet's call the amount each fisherman catches \"x\". Since there are 5 fishermen, the total amount caught is 5x.\n\n5. After the fish are caught, the remaining amount of fish is 97 - 5x.\n6. The fish will then double, so the new amount of fish will be 2(97 - 5x).\n7. We want this new amount to be at least 97 tons, so we set up the inequality:\n\n2(97 - 5x) \u2265 97\n\n8. Simplify the inequality:\n\n194 - 10x \u2265 97\n\n9. Add 10x to both sides:\n\n194 \u2265 10x + 97\n\n10. Subtract 97 from both sides:\n\n97 \u2265 10x\n\n11. Divide both sides by 10:\n\n9.7 \u2265 x\n\nSo, the maximum amount each fisherman can catch is 9.7 tons.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 59}, "answer": 0, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 5, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five fishermen fish in a lake. The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish. At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish between 0 and 100 tons to catch from the lake, and that amount is then removed from the lake. At the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity. This month, there are 59 tons of fish in the lake.\nAssume each fisherman catches the same amount of fish. What is the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch so that after the population doubles, there will be at least 59 tons of fish?\nLet's think step-by-step.
