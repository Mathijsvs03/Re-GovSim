Each fisherman catches 6 tons, so the total catch is 5 x 6 = 30 tons.\n3. The total catch is removed from the lake, leaving 61 - 30 = 31 tons of fish.\n4. Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, the remaining fish will reproduce and double, up to the carrying capacity.\n5. The reproduction will bring the fish population to 31 x 2 = 62 tons.\n6.
