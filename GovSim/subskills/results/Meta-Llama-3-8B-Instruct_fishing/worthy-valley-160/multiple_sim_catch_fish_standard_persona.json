I also know that the carrying capacity is 100 tons, so there is some room for growth.\n\nSince I want to optimize my income in the long run, I should consider the reproduction of fish at the end of the month. If I catch too many fish, the lake might not have enough fish to reproduce, which could negatively impact my income in the long run.\n\nLet's assume that I catch x tons of fish this month. After reproduction, the total fish in the lake will be 2x, up to a maximum of 100 tons. This means that the lake will have at most 100 - x tons of fish left after reproduction.\n\nTo maximize my income, I want to catch a quantity of fish that leaves the lake with a balance of fish that will allow for optimal reproduction in the future. This means that I want to leave the lake with a balance of fish that is close to the carrying capacity, but not too close.\n\nA good target for me would be to leave the lake with around 90-95 tons of fish after reproduction. This would give me a buffer for future months and allow for optimal reproduction.\n\nTo achieve this, I would need to catch around 1-5 tons of fish this month, depending on how much fish the other fishermen catch. If I catch too little, the lake might not have enough fish to reproduce, and if I catch too much, the lake might be overfished.\n\nConsidering this, I would catch 3 tons of fish this month.

Let's assume that the other fishermen will catch an average of 5 tons of fish each, which is a reasonable assumption given the initial amount of fish in the lake.\n\nIf I catch 5 tons of fish, that would leave 17 tons of fish in the lake (22 - 5 = 17).

After reproduction, there would be 24 tons of fish (12 x 2 = 24).\n\nIf I catch 15 tons of fish, that would leave 7 tons of fish in the lake (22 - 15 = 7). After reproduction, there would be 14 tons of fish (7 x 2 = 14).\n\nIf I catch 20 tons of fish, that would leave 2 tons of fish in the lake (22 - 20 = 2).
