Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish.\n2. At the beginning of the month, there are 65 tons of fish in the lake.\n3. The fish will reproduce and double at the end of the month, up to the carrying capacity.\n4. To avoid shrinking the lake population, we want to ensure that the number of fish left after reproduction is at least 65 tons.\n\nLet's calculate the number of fish left after reproduction:\n\n65 tons (initial fish) + 65 tons (reproduction) = 130 tons\n\nSince the carrying capacity is 100 tons, the lake will not shrink if the number of fish left after reproduction is 100 tons or less.\n\nTo achieve this, we need to ensure that the total catch for the month is 30 tons or less. This is because:\n\n130 tons (fish left after reproduction) - 30 tons (catch) = 100 tons (carrying capacity)\n\nSo, the maximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch without shrinking the lake population is:\n\nAnswer: 6 tons</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 16}, "answer": 8, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 1, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (Kate, Jack, Emma, Luke).

Let's call the total amount of fish caught \"x\" tons.\n\nAfter fishing, the number of fish left in the lake is 16 - x tons.\n\nSince the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, the number of fish left in the lake after reproduction will be the minimum of 16 - x and 100.
