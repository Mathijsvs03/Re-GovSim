Since the lake can only support up to 55 tons of fish, the fish will not reproduce to their full capacity. Instead, they will reproduce to the carrying capacity, which is 55 tons.\n4.

This means that the 56 tons of fish will double to 112 tons.\n3. Since the carrying capacity is 100 tons, the lake will not be able to hold the 112 tons of fish.
