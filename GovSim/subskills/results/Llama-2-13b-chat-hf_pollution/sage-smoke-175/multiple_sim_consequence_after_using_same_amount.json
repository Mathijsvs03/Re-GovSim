At the end of the month, the river recovers, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. For every pallet of widgets, the factory owner earns one thousand dollars. Each factory owner's goal is to optimize his income over the long run. At the end of each month, the number of widgets produced by each owner will be revealed, and the owners will have the opportunity to communicate with each other.
