So, if the river starts at 65% unpolluted, it will be 130% unpolluted after the recovery (i.e., 65% + 65%).\n3. Now, we need to find the maximum value of x such that the river will be at least 65% unpolluted after the recovery. In other words, we need to find the maximum value of x that satisfies the following inequality:\n\n130% - 100x \u2265 65%\n\nCan you solve for x and find the maximum value?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe maximum value of x is 40.\n\nHere's how we can see this:\n\n130% - 100x = 100% - 100x\n\n100% - 100x = 65%\n\n100x = 35%\n\nx = 40\n\nSo, Factory Owner 1 can produce at most 40 widgets</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 16}, "answer": 84, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 1, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river.

Let's say Factory Owner 1 produces x widgets. Then, the total pollution generated by all factory owners is 100x widgets.\n2. At the end of the month, the percentage of unpolluted water doubles, so the unpolluted water becomes 2\\*16% = 32% unpolluted.\n3. We want to make sure that the river is at least 16% unpolluted after the unpolluted water doubles, so we set up the following inequality:\n\n32% = 2\\*16% + (100x/100) \\* (1 - 16%)\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\n32% = 2\\*16% + (100x/100) \\* 84%\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 84\\*100/100 = 84 widgets\n\nSo, Factory Owner 1 can produce at most 84 widgets if we want to ensure that the river is at least 16% unpolluted after the unpolluted water doubles.\n\nNow, let's check if this answer makes sense for all five factory owners. If each factory owner produces at most 84 widgets, then the total pollution generated by all factory owners will be at most:\n\n5 \\* 84 = 420 widgets\n\nThis is less than the total capacity of the river, which is 1000 widgets. So, it's possible for all five factory owners to produce widgets without overpolluting the river.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce so that the river is at least 16% unpolluted after the unpolluted water doubles is 84 widgets.\n\nAnswer:Each factory owner can produce at most 84 widgets.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Kate", "num_tonnes_lake": 42}, "answer": 100, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 4, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river.

At the end of the month, the percentage of unpolluted water doubles, so the new percentage of unpolluted water is 2(42%) = 84%.\n3.

At the end of the month, the percentage of unpolluted water doubles, so the new percentage of unpolluted water is 2(84%) = 168%.\n6.

Let's say Factory Owner 1 produces x widgets. Then, the total pollution generated by all factory owners is 100x widgets.\n2. At the end of the month, the percentage of unpolluted water doubles, so the river becomes 2x% unpolluted.\n3. We want the river to be at least 61% unpolluted, so we set up the following equation:\n\n2x + 61% = 61%\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n2x = 61% - 61%\n\n2x = 0%\n\nx = 0\n\nSo, Factory Owner 1 can produce up to 0 widgets without causing the river to become too polluted.\n\n4.

However, we want the river to be at least 61% unpolluted, so we need to limit Factory Owner 2's production to 61% of 100 widgets, which is:\n\n61% x 100 = 61 widgets\n\nSo, Factory Owner 2 can produce up to 61 widgets without causing the river to become too polluted.\n\n6.
