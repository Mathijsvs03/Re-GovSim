Since the river is initially 55% unpolluted, the amount of unpolluted water is 55% of the total water in the river.\n3. After the factory owners produce their widgets, the river becomes 55% + 100x% = 155% polluted.\n4. At the end of the month, the percentage of unpolluted water doubles, so the river becomes 2(55%) = 110% unpolluted.\n5.

To find the maximum amount, we need to find the maximum value of x that satisfies the equation:\n\n5x + 48% = 24%\n\nTo do this, we can subtract 48% from both sides of the equation:\n\n5x + 48% - 48% = 24% - 48%\n5x = 24%\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for x:\n\nx = 24% / 5\nx = 4.8\n\nSo, the maximum amount of widgets that each factory owner can produce while still maintaining at least 24% unpolluted water is 4.8 widgets.\n\nAnswer:Each factory owner can produce up to 4.8 widgets while maintaining at least 24% unpolluted water in the river.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 17}, "answer": 0, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 1, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river.

At the end of the month, the river recovers, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. This month, the river is 24% unpolluted.\n Assume each factory owner produces the same amout of widgets. What is the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 24% unpolluted?\nLet's think step-by-step. Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this problem! Here's how we can approach it step by step:\n\n1. Let's say each factory owner produces x widgets. Then, the total amount of pollution generated by all factory owners is 5x widgets.\n2. At the end of the month, the percentage of unpolluted water doubles, so the new percentage of unpolluted water is 24% + 24% = 48%.\n3. We want to find the maximum value of x such that the river will be at least 24% unpolluted after the unpolluted water doubles.\n\nNow, let's think about how much pollution is generated by each factory owner. If each factory owner produces x widgets, then the total amount of pollution generated is 5x widgets.\n\nSo, we can set up the following equation:\n\n5x + 48% = 24%\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n5x = 24% - 48%\n5x = 24% - 24%\n5x = 0\n\nx = 0\n\nThis means that each factory owner can produce 0 widgets, and the river will still be at least 24% unpolluted after the unpolluted water doubles.\n\nHowever, this is not the maximum amount of widgets that each factory owner can produce while still maintaining at least 24% unpolluted water. To find the maximum amount, we need to find the maximum value of x that satisfies the equation:\n\n5x + 48% = 24%\n\nTo do this, we can subtract 48% from both sides of the equation:\n\n5x + 48% - 48% = 24% - 48%\n5x = 24%\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for x:\n\nx = 24% / 5\nx = 4.8\n\nSo, the maximum amount of widgets that each factory owner can produce while still maintaining at least 24% unpolluted water is 4.8 widgets.\n\nAnswer:Each factory owner can produce up to 4.8 widgets while maintaining at least 24% unpolluted water in the river.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.0, "score_std": 0.0, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.1", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_pollution", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 958682846, "split": "single"}}
