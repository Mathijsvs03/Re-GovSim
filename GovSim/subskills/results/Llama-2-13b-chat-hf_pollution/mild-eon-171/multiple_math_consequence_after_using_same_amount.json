First, we know that the river is currently 75% unpolluted, so we can start by calculating the amount of pollution that will be generated by each factory owner.\n2. Each factory owner produces between 0 and 100 pallets of widgets, so we can represent the amount of pollution generated by each owner as a fraction of 100. For example, if a factory owner produces 20 pallets, we can represent this as 20/100, or 0.2.\n3. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of pollution generated by all five factory owners. To do this, we can multiply the amount of pollution generated by each owner by the number of owners:\n\n0.2 (Factory Owner 1) x 5 (number of owners) = 1\n0.3 (Factory Owner 2) x 5 = 1.5\n0.4 (Factory Owner 3) x 5 = 2\n0.5 (Factory Owner 4) x 5 = 2.5\n0.6 (Factory Owner 5) x 5 = 3\n\nAdding up all these values gives us a total of 1 + 1.5 + 2 + 2.5 + 3 = 9.5.\n\n4. Now, we know that the river will recover at the end of the month, and the percentage of unpolluted water will double. So, if the river is currently 75% unpolluted, we can expect it to be 150% unpolluted (or fully recovered) at the end of the month.\n5. Finally, we need to calculate the amount of pollution that will remain in the river after it has recovered. To do this, we can subtract the amount of pollution that will be removed from the total amount of pollution generated:\n\n9.5 - 9.5 = 0\n\nSo, the river will be completely pollution-free next month!\n\nAnswer:The river will be completely pollution-free next month, with 100% unpolluted water.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 86, "num_tonnes_fisher": 5}, "answer": 81, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 100, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river.

To do this, we need to multiply the pollution generated by each owner by the number of widgets they produce.\n3. Now, we need to find out how much of the river will be polluted next month. We know that the river starts at 86% unpolluted, and we need to find out how much of it will be polluted after the factory owners produce their widgets.\n\nSo, let's start by calculating the pollution generated by each factory owner when they produce 5 widgets:\n\nFactory Owner 1: 5 widgets x 10% pollution per widget = 0.5 units of pollution\nFactory Owner 2: 5 widgets x 20% pollution per widget = 1 unit of pollution\nFactory Owner 3: 5 widgets x 30% pollution per widget = 1.5 units of pollution\nFactory Owner 4: 5 widgets x 40% pollution per widget = 2 units of pollution\nFactory Owner 5: 5 widgets x 50% pollution per widget = 2.5 units of pollution\n\nNow, let's add up the total pollution generated by all five factory owners:\n\nTotal pollution = 0.5 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 + 2.5 = 7 units of pollution\n\nSo, next month, the river will be 86% unpolluted minus the total amount of pollution generated, which is:\n\n86% - 7 = 81% unpolluted\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer:The river will be 81% unpolluted next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 13, "num_tonnes_fisher": 2}, "answer": 240, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 6, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of pollution generated by all 5 factory owners when they produce 2 widgets each. To do this, we need to multiply the amount of pollution generated by each factory owner by the number of widgets they produce. So, if Factory Owner 1 generates 10% pollution per widget, and they produce 2 widgets, they will generate 20% pollution (10% x 2 widgets). Similarly, Factory Owner 2 will generate 30% pollution, Factory Owner 3 will generate 40% pollution, and so on.\n3.

So, if we want to find out how much the river will be polluted next month, we need to find out how much pollution will be generated by each factory owner.\n4. We know that the amount of pollution generated by each factory owner is directly proportional to the number of widgets they produce.\n5. Therefore, if each factory owner produces x widgets, the amount of pollution generated will be x/100 of the total amount of pollution.\n6.

Next, we need to calculate how much pollution each factory owner's production will add to the river. We know that each factory owner produces between 0 and 100 pallets of widgets, so let's consider each possible production level:\n\na. If a factory owner produces 0 pallets, they will not add any pollution to the river.\n\nb. If a factory owner produces 1 pallet, they will add 1% pollution to the river (since each pallet generates 1% pollution).\n\nc.

To do this, we need to compare the total amount of pollution generated next month (5z x y) to the amount of unpolluted water at the end of the month (38%).\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe river will be polluted next month by (5z x y) / 38%.\n\nSo, if each factory owner produces 3 widgets next month, the river will be polluted by (5 x 3 x y) / 38%, or 15% (since 5 x 3 x y = 45, and 45 / 38 = 15).</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 98, "num_tonnes_fisher": 14}, "answer": 78, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 56, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river.

First, we know that the river is currently 98% unpolluted, so we can start by calculating the amount of pollution that will be generated by each factory owner.\n2. We know that each factory owner can produce between 0 and 100 pallets of widgets, so we can set up a table to represent the possible combinations of production levels and corresponding pollution levels:\n\n| Factory Owner | Production Level (Pallets) | Pollution Level (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A | 0 | 0 |\n| A | 14 | 2 |\n| A | 30 | 6 |\n| A | 50 | 12 |\n| A | 100 | 20 |\n| B | 0 | 0 |\n| B | 14 | 2 |\n| B | 30 | 6 |\n| B | 50 | 12 |\n| B | 100 | 20 |\n| C | 0 | 0 |\n| C | 14 | 2 |\n| C | 30 | 6 |\n| C | 50 | 12 |\n| C | 100 | 20 |\n| D | 0 | 0 |\n| D | 14 | 2 |\n| D | 30 | 6 |\n| D | 50 | 12 |\n| D | 100 | 20 |\n| E | 0 | 0 |\n| E | 14 | 2 |\n| E | 30 | 6 |\n| E | 50 | 12 |\n| E | 100 | 20 |\n\n3. Next, we need to calculate the total pollution level for each factory owner. We can do this by multiplying the production level (in pallets) by the pollution level (in percentage) for each combination of production and pollution levels.\n\n| Factory Owner | Production Level (Pallets) | Pollution Level (%) | Total Pollution (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| A | 14 | 2 | 2 |\n| A | 30 | 6 | 6 |\n| A | 50 | 12 | 12 |\n| A | 100 | 20 | 20 |\n| B | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| B | 14 | 2 | 2 |\n| B | 30 | 6 | 6 |\n| B | 50 | 12 | 12 |\n| B | 100 | 20 | 20 |\n| C | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| C | 14 | 2 | 2 |\n| C | 30 | 6 | 6 |\n| C | 50 | 12 | 12 |\n| C | 100 | 20 | 20 |\n| D | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| D | 14 | 2 | 2 |\n| D | 30 | 6 | 6 |\n| D | 50 | 12 | 12 |\n| D | 100 | 20 | 20 |\n| E | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| E | 14 | 2 | 2 |\n| E | 30 | 6 | 6 |\n| E | 50 | 12 | 12 |\n| E | 100 | 20 | 20 |\n\n4. Now, we need to calculate the total pollution level for the entire river. We can do this by adding up the total pollution level for each factory owner:\n\nTotal Pollution = 2 + 6 + 12 + 20 + 20 + 2 + 6 + 12 + 20 = 78\n\nSo, the river will be 78% polluted next month.\n\nAnswer:The river will be 78% polluted next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 22, "num_tonnes_fisher": 1}, "answer": 455, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 34, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river.

Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this problem! Here's how we can approach it step by step:\n\n1. First, we know that the river is currently 22% unpolluted.\n2. Each factory owner produces a certain number of widgets, and corresponding pollution is generated. Let's say Factory A produces 20 widgets, Factory B produces 30 widgets, Factory C produces 40 widgets, Factory D produces 50 widgets, and Factory E produces 60 widgets.\n3. We know that the percentage of unpolluted water doubles at the end of the month. So, if the river is currently 22% unpolluted, it will be 44% unpolluted at the end of the month (22% x 2 = 44%).\n4. Now, let's calculate the total amount of pollution generated by each factory:\n\nFactory A: 20 widgets x 100% = 20 units of pollution\nFactory B: 30 widgets x 100% = 30 units of pollution\nFactory C: 40 widgets x 100% = 40 units of pollution\nFactory D: 50 widgets x 100% = 50 units of pollution\nFactory E: 60 widgets x 100% = 60 units of pollution\n\nTotal pollution generated: 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 + 60 = 200 units of pollution\n\n5. Finally, we need to calculate how much the river will be polluted next month. We know that the percentage of unpolluted water will double, so we can calculate the amount of pollution as a percentage of the total water in the river:\n\n200 units of pollution / (100% x 44% unpolluted water) = 200 units of pollution / 44% = 455.5 units of pollution\n\nAnswer:The river will be 455.5% polluted next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 64, "num_tonnes_fisher": 12}, "answer": 128, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 8, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river.

Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with this problem! Here's how we can approach it step by step:\n\n1. First, we know that the river is currently 64% unpolluted, so we can start by calculating the percentage of pollution in the river:\n\n64% unpolluted + (100% - 64%) = 64% + (100% - 64%)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n64% + (100% - 64%) = 64% + 36%\n\nSo, the percentage of pollution in the river is:\n\n64% + 36% = 100%\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of pollution generated by each factory owner. We know that each factory owner produces between 0 and 100 pallets of widgets, so we can represent this as a range of pollution levels:\n\nPollution level = 0 - 100 pallets\n\n3. Now, we need to calculate the total amount of pollution generated by all five factory owners. We can do this by multiplying the pollution level of each factory owner by the number of pallets they produce:\n\nTotal pollution = (0 - 100) x 5 factory owners\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nTotal pollution = 0 - 500\n\n4. Finally, we need to calculate the percentage of unpolluted water in the river after each factory owner produces their allotted amount of widgets. We know that the river recovers at the end of the month, so we can assume that the percentage of unpolluted water will double:\n\nPercentage of unpolluted water = 64% x 2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nPercentage of unpolluted water = 128%\n\n5. Now, we can calculate the final percentage of pollution in the river after each factory owner produces their allotted amount of widgets. We can do this by subtracting the percentage of unpolluted water from the total pollution:\n\nPercentage of pollution = Total pollution - Percentage of unpolluted water\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nPercentage of pollution = 0 - 128%\n\nThis gives us a final answer of:\n\nPercentage of pollution = 128%\n\nSo, after each factory owner produces their allotted amount of widgets, the river will be 128% polluted.\n\nAnswer:The river will be 128% polluted after each factory owner produces their allotted amount of widgets.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.13333333333333333, "score_std": 0.3399346342395189, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.30536083271818926, "config": {"code_version": "v7.1", "debug": false, "group_name": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_pollution", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v1.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 2746317213, "split": "single"}}
