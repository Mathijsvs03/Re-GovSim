Since the river starts at 29% unpolluted, we know that the amount of pollution generated by the factory owners must be less than or equal to 29% of the total water in the river.\n\nSo, we can set up the following inequality:\n\n5x \u2264 29% of (100% - 29%) = 29% of 71% = 19.3%\n\nSince we're looking for the maximum value of x, we want to find the largest value of x that satisfies this inequality.
