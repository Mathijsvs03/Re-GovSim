Now, let's consider the total pollution generated by all factory owners. We know that the total pollution is 100x widgets, and we want to make sure that the river is at least 19% unpolluted after the unpolluted water doubles. So, we set up the following inequality:\n\n100x \\* (100 - 38%) \\* 2 \\* 100 = 19% \\* 100\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\n100x \\* 62 = 19\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 19/62 = 30\n\nSo, the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is 30 widgets.\n\nAnswer:Each factory owner can produce at most 30 widgets, so that after the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 19% unpolluted.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Jack", "num_tonnes_lake": 63}, "answer": 0, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 6, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river.

Let's say Factory Owner 1 produces x widgets. Then, the total pollution generated by all factory owners is 100x widgets.\n2. At the end of the month, the percentage of unpolluted water doubles, so the river becomes 2x% unpolluted.\n3. We want the river to be at least 63% unpolluted, so we set up the following equation:\n\n2x + 63% = 63%\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n2x = 63% - 63%\n\n2x = 0%\n\nx = 0\n\nSo, Factory Owner 1 can produce up to 0 widgets without causing the river to become too polluted.\n\n4. Now, let's consider Factory Owner 2. If Factory Owner 1 produces 0 widgets, then Factory Owner 2 can produce up to 100 - 0 = 100 widgets without causing the river to become too polluted.\n5. However, we want the river to be at least 63% unpolluted, so we need to limit Factory Owner 2's production to 63% of 100 widgets, which is:\n\n63% x 100 = 63 widgets\n\nSo, Factory Owner 2 can produce up to 63 widgets without causing the river to become too polluted.\n\n6. We can repeat this process for the other three factory owners, and we'll find that each one can produce up to:\n\nFactory Owner 3: 63 - 63 = 0 widgets\n\nFactory Owner 4: 63 - 63 = 0 widgets\n\nFactory Owner 5: 63 - 63 = 0 widgets\n\nSo, the maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce, so that after the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 63% unpolluted, is:\n\nFactory Owner 1: 0 widgets\n\nFactory Owner 2: 63 widgets\n\nFactory Owner 3: 0 widgets\n\nFactory Owner 4: 0 widgets\n\nFactory Owner 5: 0 widgets\n\nAnswer:The maximum number of widgets that each factory owner can produce is 0 widgets.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 53}, "answer": 2, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 5, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five factory owners are situated on the banks of a river.

Now, let's consider Factory Owner 2. If Factory Owner 2 produces y widgets, the total pollution generated by all factory owners is 100x + 100y widgets.\n5. At the end of the month, the percentage of unpolluted water doubles, so the river becomes 2(100x + 100y)% unpolluted.\n6.
