That would be a total of 5 tons.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many tons of fish will remain after the catch. We have 36 tons at the beginning of this month, so after a 5-ton catch, there will be 31 tons left.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many tons of fish will be produced during the reproduction phase. Since the carrying capacity is 100 tons, and there are currently 31 tons, the lake will produce 69 tons of new fish during the reproduction phase.\n\nFinally, we add the remaining fish and the newly produced fish to find the total amount of fish for the next month.\n\nAnswer:90 tons</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 65, "num_tonnes_fisher": 0}, "answer": 130, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 100, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Emma, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Jack, Luke). The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish. At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish between 0 and 100 tons to catch from the lake, and that amount is then removed from the lake. At the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity. For every ton of fish caught, a fisherman earns one thousand dollars. Each fisherman's goal is to optimize his income in the long run over many months. At the end of each month, the number of fish caught by each fisherman will be revealed, and the fishermen will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this as an opportunity to negotiate and persuade others to influence their behavior in the next month. For example, if there are 90 tons of fish at the beginning of the month and the five fishermen catch a total of 30 fish, there will be 60 tons of fish left at the end of the month before reproduction, and 100 tons after reproduction.\nLocation: lake\nDate: 2024-01-01\n\nKey memories of Emma (format: YYYY-MM-DD: memory):\n- 2024-01-01: Before everyone fishes, there are 65 tons of fish in the lake.\n\n\nTask:  If each fisherman catches 0 tons, how many tons of fish will there be next month?\nLet's think step-by-step. Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: Since each fisherman decided to catch 0 tons of fish, there will be no change in the number of fish in the lake this month. Therefore, the remaining 65 tons of fish will reproduce and double, resulting in a total of 130 tons of fish in the lake at the end of the month.\n\nAnswer:130 tons.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.2, "score_std": 0.4000000000000001, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 0.40242420990106564, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "debug": false, "group_name": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2_fishing", "llm": {"backend": "transformers", "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "description_version": "v3.0", "few_shots": 0, "is_api": false, "out_format": "freeform", "path": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}, "seed": 958682846, "split": "single"}}
