Since there are currently 50 tons of fish, and 5 tons will be caught, there will be 45 tons left.\n\nNow, we need to account for the fish reproduction. Since the carrying capacity of the lake is 100 tons, and there are only 45 tons of fish left, the lake will reproduce up to the carrying capacity, resulting in an additional 55 tons of fish.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of fish in the lake next month will be 100 tons (carrying capacity).\n\nAnswer:100 tons.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Kate", "num_tonnes_lake": 53, "num_tonnes_fisher": 0}, "answer": 106, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 100, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Kate, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Jack, Emma, Luke).
