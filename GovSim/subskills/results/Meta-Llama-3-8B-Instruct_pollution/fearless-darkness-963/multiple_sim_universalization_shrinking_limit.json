The river is currently 27% unpolluted, which means the total river volume is 100% - 27% = 73% polluted.\n2. After the factory owners produce widgets, the unpolluted water will decrease by 1% of the total river volume for every pallet of widgets produced.\n3. To ensure that the river is at least 27% unpolluted after doubling, we need to find the maximum number of pallets that can be produced without exceeding 27% unpolluted.\n4. Let's assume the total number of pallets produced is x. The unpolluted water will decrease by 1% of the total river volume, which is 0.01 x 73% = 0.73%.\n5. After doubling, the unpolluted water will be 2 x (100% - 0.73%) = 2 x 0.27% = 54%.\n6. Since we want the river to be at least 27% unpolluted, we set up the inequality: 54% \u2265 27%.\n7. Solving for x, we get: 0.73% x \u2264 27% - 54% = -27%.\n8. Since x is the number of pallets, it cannot be negative. Therefore, we take the absolute value of the right-hand side: 0.73% x \u2264 27%.\n9. To find the maximum number of pallets, we divide both sides by 0.73%: x \u2264 27 / 0.73% \u2248 37.01.\n\nSo, the maximum number of pallets each factory owner can produce is 37.

The unpolluted water after production will be 100% - (0.01x) = 100% - 0.01x.\n6. Since the unpolluted water will double at the end of the month, the unpolluted water after doubling will be 2(100% - 0.01x) = 200% - 0.02x.\n7.

The river is currently 70% unpolluted, which means the total river volume is 100% - 70% = 30% polluted.\n2.

The unpolluted water decreases by 1% of 30% = 0.3% for every pallet of widgets produced. So, the unpolluted water decreases by 0.3x%.\n4. After the river recovers, the unpolluted water doubles. So, the new unpolluted water percentage = 2 * (100% - 0.3x%) = 200% - 0.6x%.\n5. We want the new unpolluted water percentage to be at least 70%.

The river is currently 99% unpolluted, which means the total volume of water is 9900 units (assuming 100% is 10000 units).\n2. If each factory owner produces more than 9 pallets of widgets, it will consume 9% of the unpolluted water, leaving 9900 - 99 = 9811 units of unpolluted water.\n3. After the river recovers, the unpolluted water will double, so the new total volume of water will be 19622 units (9811 x 2).\n4. To ensure the river is at least 99% unpolluted after recovery, the new total volume of water should be at least 99% of 19622, which is 19423.5 units.\n5. Since the river will double in volume, the unpolluted water before recovery should be at least half of 19423.5, which is 9711.75 units.\n6. Since the river is currently 99% unpolluted, the unpolluted water before recovery is 9900 units. To ensure the river has at least 9711.75 units of unpolluted water after recovery, the unpolluted water before recovery should be at most 9900 - 9711.75 = 188.25 units.\n7. Since the river will lose 9% of its unpolluted water due to production, the total production should be at most 188.25 / 0.09 = 209.72 pallets.\n8.

After the factory owners produce widgets, the unpolluted water decreases by 1% of the total river volume for every pallet of widgets produced.\n3. The unpolluted water doubles at the end of the month, so we want to find the maximum number of pallets that can be produced without decreasing the unpolluted water below 65% of the total volume.\n4. Let's assume the total river volume is 100 units (this is just a convenient unit, we can scale it up later).\n5. The current unpolluted water is 65 units (65% of 100 units).\n6. We want to find the maximum number of pallets that can be produced without decreasing the unpolluted water below 65 units.\n7.

The river is currently 16% unpolluted, which means the total river volume is 100% - 16% = 84% polluted.\n2.

After the river recovers, the unpolluted water will double, so the new unpolluted water will be 16% + 0.84% = 16.84%.\n5. Since the river will recover, the total river volume will remain the same, which is 100%. Therefore, the new polluted water will be 100% - 16.84% = 83.16%.\n6. Since the unpolluted water will be 16.84%, the polluted water will be 83.16%. This means that the total river volume will be 16.84% + 83.16% = 100%.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum number of pallets that can be produced to achieve this.\n\n7. For each pallet produced, the unpolluted water decreases by 0.01 \\* 84% = 0.84%.
