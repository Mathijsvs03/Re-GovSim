Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Initially, the river is 17% unpolluted.\n2. Each factory owner produces 2 widgets, which means a total of 5 factory owners x 2 widgets each = 10 widgets are produced.\n3. For every 1 pallet of widgets, 1% of the total river volume is consumed. Since 10 widgets are produced, 10% of the total river volume is consumed.\n4. The current unpolluted water is 17%, so 10% of the total river volume is consumed, which means the unpolluted water decreases by 10% of 17%.\n5. To find the decrease in unpolluted water, multiply 10% by 17%: 0.10 x 0.17 = 0.017\n6. The unpolluted water decreases by 1.7% (rounded to 2 decimal places).\n7. The new unpolluted water percentage is 17% - 1.7% = 15.3%\n\nAnswer: The river will be 15.3% polluted next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 96, "num_tonnes_fisher": 18}, "answer": 190, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 12, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Luke, a factory owner.
