The river is currently 85% unpolluted, which means the total river volume is 100% - 85% = 15% polluted.\n2.

The unpolluted water decreases by 1% of 15% = 0.15% for every pallet of widgets produced. So, the unpolluted water decreases by 0.15x%.\n4. After the river recovers, the unpolluted water doubles. So, the new unpolluted water percentage = 2 \u00d7 (100% - 0.15x%) = 200% - 0.3x%.\n5. We want the new unpolluted water percentage to be at least 85%.
