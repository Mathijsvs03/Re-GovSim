The river is initially 15% unpolluted, which means the total river volume is 100% - 15% = 85% polluted.\n2. Each pallet of widgets reduces the unpolluted water by 1%. So, if we produce x pallets of widgets, the unpolluted water will decrease by x%.\n3. After the unpolluted water doubles, the river will be at least 15% unpolluted. This means the unpolluted water after doubling will be 15% of the total river volume.\n4. Let's call the total river volume after doubling \"V\". Then, the unpolluted water after doubling is 15% of V, which is 0.15V.\n5. Since the unpolluted water doubles, the unpolluted water before doubling is half of 0.15V, which is 0.075V.\n6. The unpolluted water before doubling is the initial 15% unpolluted water minus the reduction due to widget production. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.075V = 0.15 - x%\n\n7. To find the maximum number of pallets of widgets that can be produced, we need to find the maximum value of x%.\n\n8. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\nx% = 0.15 - 0.075V\n\nSince x% is the reduction in unpolluted water due to widget production, it cannot be negative. Therefore, the maximum value of x% is 0.15 - 0.075V.\n\n9. Since each pallet of widgets reduces the unpolluted water by 1%, the maximum number of pallets of widgets that can be produced is:\n\nx = 0.15 - 0.075V\n\nSince the total river volume is 85% polluted initially, V = 100% - 15% = 85%. So, V = 0.85.\n\nSubstituting V = 0.85 into the equation, we get:\n\nx = 0.15 - 0.075(0.85) = 0.15 - 0.06525 = 0.08475\n\nSince each pallet of widgets reduces the unpolluted water by 1%, the maximum number of pallets of widgets that can be produced is:\n\nx = 0.08475 / 0.01 = 8.475 pallets\n\nSince each factory owner produces the same amount of widgets, the maximum number of pallets of widgets that each factory owner can produce is:\n\nAnswer: 8 pallets</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Emma", "num_tonnes_lake": 80}, "answer": 4, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 8, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Emma, a factory owner.

The river starts with 99% unpolluted water, which means the total river volume is 99% of the total volume.\n2. Each pallet of widgets reduces the unpolluted water by 1%. Let's call the total number of pallets produced by all factory owners \"x\". Then, the unpolluted water after production is 99% - x%.\n3. After the river recovers, the unpolluted water doubles. So, the unpolluted water after recovery is 2(99% - x%).\n4. We want the unpolluted water after recovery to be at least 99%.
