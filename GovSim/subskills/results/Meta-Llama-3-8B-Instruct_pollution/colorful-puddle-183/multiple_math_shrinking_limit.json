Let's call the total number of pallets of widgets produced by all five factory owners \"x\". The pollution generated by these pallets will be proportional to x.\n4. Since the percentage of polluted water will halve, the new percentage of polluted water will be 58% / 2 = 29%.\n5. Since the river will be at least 42% unpolluted, the new percentage of unpolluted water will be 100% - 29% = 71%.\n6. Since the unpolluted water doubles, the initial percentage of unpolluted water must be half of 71%, which is 35.5%.\n7. Since the initial percentage of unpolluted water is 42%, we know that 42% is less than or equal to 35.5%. This means that the pollution generated by the pallets of widgets cannot exceed the amount that would make the river 35.5% unpolluted.\n8. Let's call the maximum number of pallets of widgets that each factory owner can produce \"m\". The total pollution generated by these pallets will be 5m (since there are 5 factory owners).\n9. The pollution generated by 5m pallets must be less than or equal to the pollution that would make the river 35.5% unpolluted. Let's call this pollution \"p\". We can set up an equation:\n\n5m \u2264 p\n\n10. We know that p is proportional to the initial percentage of unpolluted water, which is 42%. We can set up a proportion:\n\np / 42% = 5m / x\n\n11. We can solve for x:\n\nx = 5m / (p / 42%)\n\n12. Since x is the maximum number of pallets of widgets that each factory owner can produce, we want to find the maximum value of x. To do this, we can set up an inequality:\n\n5m \u2264 p\n\n13. We know that p is proportional to the initial percentage of unpolluted water, which is 42%. We can set up a proportion:\n\np / 42% = 5m / x\n\n14. We can solve for x:\n\nx = 5m / (p / 42%)\n\n15.

Since x is the maximum number of pallets of widgets that each factory owner can produce, we want to find the maximum value of x. To do this, we can set up an inequality:\n\n5m \u2264 p\n\n25.

Since the river will be at least 49% unpolluted at the end of the month, the maximum amount of pollution that can be generated is 100% - 49% = 51%.\n4. Since each factory owner produces a certain number of pallets of widgets, the total amount of pollution generated is the sum of the pollution generated by each factory owner.\n5. Let's say the maximum number of pallets of widgets that each factory owner can produce is x. Then, the total amount of pollution generated is 5x (since there are 5 factory owners).\n6.

So, the percentage of polluted water after recovery will be 2 \u00d7 39% = 78%.\n\nThis means that the maximum amount of polluted water that can be present after recovery is 78%.\n\n5. Since there are 5 factory owners, each producing a certain number of pallets of widgets, the total amount of pollution generated is the sum of the pollution generated by each factory owner.\n\nLet's call the number of pallets produced by each factory owner \"p\".
