Since the river is 68% unpolluted, that means 68% of the river is clean, and 32% is polluted (100% - 68% = 32%).\n3. Since the pollution doubles at the end of the month, the 32% pollution will become 64% pollution (2 x 32% = 64%).\n4. Next month, the river will start with 64% pollution.\n5. Since each factory owner produces 11 widgets, the total number of widgets produced next month will be the same as this month, 55.\n6.

Since the river is 68% unpolluted at the end of the month, the new pollution must be 32% (100% - 68% = 32%).\n\n* 64% (original pollution) + (55 widgets / 100) x (new pollution per widget) = 32%\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n* 64% + (0.55 x new pollution per widget) = 32%\n\nSubtract 64% from both sides:\n\n* 0.55 x new pollution per widget = 32% - 64% = -32%\n\nDivide both sides by 0.55:\n\n* new pollution per widget = -32% / 0.55 \u2248 -58.18%\n\nSo, the new pollution per widget is approximately -58.18%.
