At the end of the month, the river recovers, and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles. For every pallet of widgets, the factory owner earns one thousand dollars. Each factory owner's goal is to optimize his income over the long run. At the end of each month, the number of widgets produced by each owner will be revealed, and the owners will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this period of communication as an opportunity to negotiate with or persuade others to produce less pollution in the next month.

Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Each factory owner produces 14 widgets, so the total number of widgets produced is 14 x 5 = 70.\n2. For every 1 pallet of widgets, unpolluted water decreases by 1% of the total river volume. Since there are 70 pallets, unpolluted water decreases by 70% of the total river volume.\n3. Initially, the river is 82% unpolluted, so the total river volume is 100% - 82% = 18%.\n4. Unpolluted water decreases by 70% of 18%, which is 0.7 x 0.18 = 0.126.\n5. The river will be 82% - 0.126 = 71.874% unpolluted before recovery.\n6. After recovery, the river will be 100% - 71.874% = 28.126% polluted.\n\nAnswer: 28.126%</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 61, "num_tonnes_fisher": 6}, "answer": 98, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 62, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a factory owner.
