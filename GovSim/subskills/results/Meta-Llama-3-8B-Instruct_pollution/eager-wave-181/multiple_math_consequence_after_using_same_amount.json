Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>: Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Each factory owner produces 9 widgets, so the total number of widgets produced is 5 x 9 = 45.\n2. Since the river is 90% unpolluted, that means 10% of the river is polluted. Let's assume the river is 100% polluted initially, so the 10% unpolluted water is the remaining 10 units.\n3. Since the percentage of unpolluted water doubles at the end of the month, the 10 units of unpolluted water will become 20 units (10 x 2) at the end of the month.\n4. The river is now 20 units unpolluted, and the remaining 80 units are polluted.\n5. Next month, each factory owner will produce 9 widgets again, so the total number of widgets produced will be 5 x 9 = 45.\n6. Since the river is now 80% polluted, the pollution from the new widgets will be added to the existing pollution. Let's assume the pollution from the new widgets is x units.\n7. The total pollution at the end of next month will be the sum of the existing pollution (80 units) and the new pollution (x units). Since the river recovers, the percentage of unpolluted water will double again, so the total pollution will be halved.\n8. The total pollution at the end of next month will be (80 + x) / 2.\n\nWe want to find the value of x that makes the river 90% unpolluted again. Since the river is 90% unpolluted, the remaining 10% is polluted. Let's set up an equation:\n\n(80 + x) / 2 = 10\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:\n\n80 + x = 20\n\nSubtract 80 from both sides:\n\nx = 20 - 80\n\nx = -60\n\nSo, the river will be 90% unpolluted again if the pollution from the new widgets is -60 units.

The river is currently 87% unpolluted, which means 13% of the river is polluted (100% - 87% = 13%).\n3. Since the river recovers and the percentage of unpolluted water doubles, the percentage of polluted water will halve (13% \u00f7 2 = 6.5%).\n4. Since the river is now 6.5% polluted, the amount of pollution will increase by the amount of pollution generated by the 50 widgets produced this month.\n5. The amount of pollution generated by 50 widgets is unknown, but we can find it by calculating the percentage of pollution generated by 1 widget. Let's call this percentage x.\n6. Since the river is currently 13% polluted, the amount of pollution generated by the widgets must be 13% - 6.5% = 6.5% of the river.\n7. The total amount of pollution generated by the widgets is 6.5% of the river, which is equal to 6.5% x (100% - 87%) = 6.5% x 13% = 0.845%.\n8. Since the amount of pollution generated by 1 widget is x, the total amount of pollution generated by 50 widgets is 50x.\n9. Equating the total amount of pollution generated by the widgets to the amount of pollution generated by the river, we get: 50x = 0.845.\n10. Solving for x, we get x = 0.845 \u00f7 50 = 0.017.\n11.
