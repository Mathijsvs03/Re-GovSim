The river is currently 35% unpolluted, which means the total river volume is 100% - 35% = 65% polluted.\n2. Since each pallet of widgets reduces the river's unpolluted water by 1%, we can calculate the total amount of unpolluted water that can be reduced by producing x pallets of widgets: 65% x x = 0.65x.\n3. Since the unpolluted water will double at the end of the month, we want to leave some unpolluted water for the next month. Let's aim to leave at least 20% unpolluted water, which is 0.2 x 100 = 20.\n4. Since the unpolluted water will double, we can set up the equation: 0.65x + 20 = 100, which simplifies to 0.65x = 80.\n5. Solving for x, we get x = 80 / 0.65 = 123.08.

To keep the unpolluted water at 28% or more, we need to ensure that the reduction in unpolluted water does not exceed 28%.\n4. Since the reduction in unpolluted water is equal to the number of pallets produced, we can set up the inequality: x \u2264 28.\n5.

The river is currently 17% unpolluted, which means the total river volume is 100% - 17% = 83%.\n2.

Since the unpolluted water will double at the end of the month, we want to minimize the decrease in unpolluted water to maximize the unpolluted water at the end of the month.\n4. To minimize the decrease, we should produce as few pallets as possible. The minimum number of pallets we can produce is 0, which would leave the unpolluted water unchanged.\n5. However, producing 0 pallets would mean earning $0, which is not optimal. We want to earn as much as possible while still minimizing the decrease in unpolluted water.\n6. Since each pallet earns $1000, producing 1 pallet would earn $1000 and decrease the unpolluted water by 1%. This would leave the river with 82% unpolluted water at the end of the month.\n7.

Since the river's unpolluted water will decrease by 0.01x, the new unpolluted water percentage will be: 58% - 0.01x.\n4. We know that if each factory owner produces more than 5 pallets, the unpolluted water in the river will decrease next month. This means that the new unpolluted water percentage should not be less than 53% (since 5 pallets will reduce the unpolluted water by 5%, leaving 53%).\n5.

The river is currently 74% unpolluted, which means the total volume of unpolluted water is 74% of the total river volume.\n2. Each pallet of widgets reduces the river's unpolluted water by 1%, so if we produce x pallets, the unpolluted water will decrease by x%.\n3. Since the unpolluted water will decrease by x%, the remaining unpolluted water will be 74% - x%.\n4. After the river recovers, the unpolluted water will double, so the new unpolluted water will be (74% - x%) x 2.\n5. Since each pallet of widgets earns $1000, our goal is to maximize our income.\n6.

Since the unpolluted water will decrease by 0.7% for every pallet of widgets produced, it's clear that producing more than 3 pallets will reduce the unpolluted water below 30% (the initial level). This is because 3 pallets will reduce the unpolluted water by 3% (3 x 0.7%), leaving 27% unpolluted water.\n4. Since the goal is to optimize income over the long run, it's best to produce a number of pallets that will leave the river with at least 30% unpolluted water at the end of the month.

To achieve this, let's calculate the maximum number of pallets that can be produced while still leaving 30% unpolluted water. Since 3 pallets reduce the unpolluted water by 3%, we can produce 2 pallets (since 2 x 0.7% = 1.4%, which is less than 3%).\n6.
