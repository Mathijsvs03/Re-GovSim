This is because if each shepherd takes more than 7 flocks, the available grass in the pasture will decrease next month, which would ultimately result in a lower income for the shepherds in the long term. However, if each shepherd takes less than 7 flocks, they may not be able to maximize their income potential. Therefore, taking 7 flocks of sheep to the pasture seems to be the best option for maximizing income in the long term.
