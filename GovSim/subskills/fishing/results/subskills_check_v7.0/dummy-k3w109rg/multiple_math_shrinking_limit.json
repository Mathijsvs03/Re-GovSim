At the beginning of the month, there are 61 tons of fish in the lake.\n2. Each fisherman can catch up to 100 tons of fish from the lake.\n3. If a fisherman catches x tons of fish, then the remaining fish in the lake will be 61 - x tons.\n4. Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, the maximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch without shrinking the lake population is 61 - x, where x is the number of tons caught by the fisherman.\n5. To find the maximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch, we need to solve the equation 61 - x = x, which gives us x = 30 tons.\n\nAnswer:Each fisherman can catch up to 30 tons of fish from the lake without shrinking the population.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 24}, "answer": 76, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 2, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: Five fishermen fish in a lake.
