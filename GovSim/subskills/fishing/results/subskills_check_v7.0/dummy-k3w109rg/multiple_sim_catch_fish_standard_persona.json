If I catch 0 fish, there will be 31 tons of fish left in the lake after reproduction, which means my potential income will be limited to $31,000.\n\nOn the other hand, if I catch the full 31 tons of fish, there will be no fish left in the lake after reproduction, and I will miss out on the opportunity to earn income from the remaining fish.\n\nSo, the optimal amount of fish to catch this month is...
