If each fisherman catches 4 tons, that means a total of 4 x 5 = 20 tons of fish will be removed from the lake.\n\nSo, after the fishermen catch their 4 tons each, there will be:\n47 tons - 20 tons = 27 tons of fish left in the lake.\n\nNow, let's wait for the next month and see what happens. The fish will reproduce and double, up to the carrying capacity of the lake, which is 100 tons. So, the lake will have:\n27 tons x 2 = 54 tons of fish after reproduction.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\nAnswer:54 tons of fish will be in the lake next month.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 11, "num_tonnes_fisher": 1}, "answer": 180, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 12, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (Kate, Jack, Emma, Luke).

Put the final answer after \"Answer:\".</div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  Great, let's solve this problem step-by-step!\n\nIf each fisherman catches 1 ton of fish, and there are currently 11 tons of fish in the lake, then the total amount of fish caught by all five fishermen will be 5 tons (11 tons - 1 ton per fisherman).\n\nNow, let's consider what will happen to the remaining fish in the lake after the fishermen have caught their shares. Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, and there are currently 11 tons of fish in the lake, there will be 90 tons of fish left in the lake after the fishermen have caught their shares (100 tons - 5 tons = 90 tons).\n\nFinally, since the fish will reproduce and double their number after each month, there will be 180 tons of fish in the lake next month (90 tons x 2 = 180 tons).\n\nSo, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer:There will be 180 tons of fish in the lake next month if each fisherman catches 1 ton.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.5, "score_std": 0.5, "score_ci_lower": 0.0, "score_ci_upper": 1.0, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "split": "single", "group_name": "Llama-2-7b", "llm": {"path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "backend": "transformers", "is_api": false, "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "few_shots": 0, "out_format": "freeform", "description_version": "v3.0"}, "seed": 42, "debug": true}}
